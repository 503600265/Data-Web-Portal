Toyz
‘It would encourage me, you know, to think... or rather it would comfort
me, no, wrong word, well, maybe the right word, but it would, you know,
inspire me but at the same time sort of soothe me in an all-is-well-in-heaven-
and-earth kind of way to think, ah, what am I trying to say here?’

Som was sitting on an upturned black flight case, rocking it back ten or
fifteen degrees as he rolled his heels on the frosted gravel in front of Bett’s
mansion. Lex wished he wouldn't do that, really wished he wouldn’t do that.
Okay, it was Som’s case, Som’s stuff, and maybe he was cool with the contents
getting clattered in the less-than-improbable event that his feet slipped and
put him on his skinny Thai ass, but that wasn’t the point. It was bad prac-
tice. There were several black flight cases sitting out there with the three of
them in the cold tonight, as on any such night, and Lex didn’t much like the
thought of Som using the vessel of her fragile, delicately packed and fastidi-
ously inventoried kit as a makeshift shooting stick. Weighing further upon her
discomfiture was the fact that Armand’s flight cases were occasionally known
to accommodate materials sufficient to denude the immediate vicinity of any
standing structure, mammalian life, or even vegetation.

‘Som, you're 404-ing,’ she warned him.

‘Sorry. I’m just saying, wouldn’t you love to believe that somewhere in this
world there really is at least one — just one — hollowed-out volcano containing
a super high-tech ops base under the command of a fully fledged evil genius?
I mean, I could live with all the havoc the evil genius might wreak simply to
know there was a facility like that in existence. It would just make the world a
more fantastical place, don’t you reckon? In a Santa-really-does-exist-after-all
kind of way, you know?’

‘Would it need to have a retractable roof for space-rockets and nuclear mis-
siles to launch through?’ Armand asked, bringing a measured irritation to
bear in the precision of his accented pronunciation.

Td settle for a submarine dock,’ Som responded, with an equally measured,
deliberate guilelessness.

‘So,’ the Frenchman said, ‘the thought of an actual, existent, staffed and
fully functioning underground base doesn’t, how would you say, blow your

1

hair back? It must be inside a hollowed-out volcano and run by a cackling
megalomaniac or it’s merely part of the crushing ordinariness of life’s relent-
lessly drab ennui?’

‘Not at all,’ Som protested. ‘I didn’t say that. Did I say that?’

‘No, but you could be more “up” about it,’ Armand complained. ‘I’ve been
looking forward to this, you know. Really looking forward to it.’

Lex smiled to herself at the sight of Armand — mercenary, soldier, explosives
adept and trained killer — putting on a petted lip and acting like a disappointed
child for the express purpose of winding up a scrawny adolescent techno-geek
half his age.

Tm “up”, Som insisted. ‘’m extremely up. I’m looking forward to it as
much as you. I’m just, you know, insulating myself against disappointment.’

‘A pitifully negative approach to life,’ Armand condemned.

‘Easy for you to say. When I was a kid, my parents took me to Tunisia, and
we went to visit the place they filmed Star Wars. I was eight years old, and—

Pitifully negative,’ Armand repeated. And cowardly to boot.’

Tm just saying, I’d love to believe it’ll be all chrome and glass and LED
read-outs everywhere, but I’m preparing myself in case it’s just a quarry with
a roof.’

‘Silence, coward. Be gone. Alexis, ma chére, when Rebekah gets here with
our transport, I’m going to sit up front with our designated driver. Sorry to
land you with Som, but I plan on enjoying myself this evening and I don’t
want him “bumming me out”.’

‘Yeah, sure,’ Lex said, rolling her eyes. ‘That’s why you want to sit beside
Rebekah. Forget it. It'll be girls in the front, boys in the back. I’ve been waiting
years for some female solidarity around here.’

Armand waved dismissively at her, but knew she wouldn’t be giving ground,
just as she knew he had no intention of sitting anywhere but next to his play-
mate. There had to be twenty years between them, but as Som and Armand’s
relationship seemed to be based upon bringing out each other’s inner thirteen-
year-old, the age gap was irrelevant to their inseparable (and often insuffer-
able) camaraderie. It was the female solidarity she was less sure about. Re-
bekah had been with the outfit a month now and, despite being the only other
female, they’d barely engaged in anything other than the most perfunctory of
exchanges.

This was pretty familiar, however. Lex had seen it before, in herself and,
more recently, in Somboon. The blasé and cocky figure who was so non-
chalantly leaning on easily fifty thousand dollars’ worth of electronics, as he
bantered about the interior fittings of the underground weapons facility they
were about to assault, might fail to recognise the hunched and introverted
serial nail-biter who’d barely managed anything more articulate than gaze-

averted mumbles for the first month in their company. Rebekah had been less
physically withdrawn than Som was during those earliest days, and she looked
unused to shrinking from anyone’s gaze, not least because she was five-nine
and a looker. She was always straight-backed and forthright in her posture,
but this struck Lex as a conditioned reflex, a body-language statement of ‘no
comment’. When she did speak, her accent was American, the delivery a lit-
tle clipped and forced, like discipline was overruling shyness and more than
a little fear. Som had once referred to her as ‘the she-bot’, a throwaway re-
mark that nonetheless accurately identified something automated about her
behaviour.

Rebekah had been unquestionably scared, nervous of her new environment
and untrusting of its apparent security; noticeably starting at telephones and
doorbells and, rather curiously, at overhead aircraft. Post-traumatic stress
disorder, or what used to be known as plain old shell-shock, any observer
might reasonably have diagnosed, but Lex could identify the symptoms of a
more specific anxiety: that of the fugitive. The girl was still waiting for a
trapdoor to open beneath her.

‘Lex, you’re welcome to sit with Rebekah, far as I’m concerned,’ Som said.
‘I figure “the Transport Manager” has gotta have some serious driving skillz.
She’s gonna be throwing that bus around, man. I don’t want a front-row seat.’

‘ could hear that z, Som,’ Lex warned him. ‘You’ve got to drop the leet
speak. Seriously. I’m the hacker here.’

Tm so grateful to the American cultural imperialists that they have made
English the international language of code-crunchers and keypad monkeys,’
Armand said with a sigh, the steam of his breath billowing affectedly in the
moonlight. ‘It would pain me too much to hear French so vandalised.’

‘Ah, bullshit,’ Som replied. ‘French is just too effete-sounding to be of any
use with technology. I mean, listen: ordinateur. That sounds like something
that runs on steam, with, like, brass fittings and a big wooden plinth.’

‘Exactly. You describe elegance and grace, agelessness and finery. That is
French. Plastic, fibreglass, coils of tangled cable, porno download, shoot-em-
up — English, English, English.’

Fuck you.’

‘Encore, Anglais, Anglais, Anglais.’

‘Our new Transport Manager.’ That was how Rebekah had been introduced
by Bett, with their leader’s typically cryptic brevity. Each one of them came
here with two things: a talent and a past. Everybody would find out the
former soon enough, but only Bett would be privy to the latter.

Bett knew everyone’s past, but nobody knew his. There were fragments
one could piece together, clues in remarks and logical assumptions, but they
didn’t render a whole that was either coherent or remotely vivid. Some mili-

tary involvement, obviously. Police work, here in France and possibly further
afield. No wife, no children, no siblings or parents ever referred to. Multilin-
gual. First language: pick one from three. Accent unplaceable. Provenance
unknowable. A cipher, and yet known in certain influential circles. Private,
and yet highly connected. Cold, and yet conscientiously loyal. Solitary, and
yet surrounding himself with cohorts, generally much younger, who were en-
ergetic and often immature.

Bett collected them, brought to his attention by shadowy contacts and
murkily submerged channels of information. Rescued them, no question,
from each of their secret pasts, but he kept hold of those secrets too, an
unspoken but ever-looming means of leverage. His employees were thus a
remarkable raggle-taggle of waifs and strays, who found themselves grateful
but beholden, and not a little scared. Lex didn’t know anyone else’s story
for certain, but guessed they would share a number of elements, prominent
among them a precipitous epiphany regarding the price a single rash act could
exact from what one only now realised had been a bright future.

In her case, she put it down to adolescent impetuousness and misdirected
anger. Mistakes we all made on the road to adulthood, lessons we could only
learn first hand. Nineteen was a difficult age. Anything beyond twelve, in
fact, was a difficult age, but turning nineteen stuck in the mind as being espe-
cially tough — something to do with her parents’ marriage breaking up around
that particular birthday, which happened to be September 12th 2001. Ado-
lescent impetuousness. Alienation. Despair. Misdirected anger. A common
enough story. You let your feelings get the better of you and you do some-
thing that makes sense at the time, but which will have far more damaging
consequences than you have the vision or clarity to foresee from your emo-
tional and immature perspective. Such as getting shit-faced and totalling your
dad’s car, deliberately screwing up your exams, selling off your mom’s heir-
loom jewellery, or causing an overseas emergency and mid-level international
diplomatic crisis from inside your Toronto bedroom.

Yeah. Oops, huh?

Seemed like a compelling idea at the time. Her own private act of post
9-11 anger, prompted largely by the war in Afghanistan and not at all by
her parents’ marriage disintegrating. Afghanistan. That’s where they were
bombing. What the hell was there to bomb in Afghanistan? Wouldn’t they
have to send some army engineers over there to build some shit first, kinda to
make the bombing runs worthwhile? Nineteen of the hijackers were Saudis.
Bin Laden was a Saudi. The money was Saudi, the ideological pressure was
Saudi. So let’s bomb Afghanistan. Fuck that.

She shut down a power station near Jedda and halted production in two
major oilfields for close to eight hours. It was embarrassingly easy. In fact,

if it had been even slightly harder, maybe she’d have stopped to think a little
more about just what the hell she was doing. It didn’t even take very long,
nor was it a particularly cute or elegant hack. She just enslaved a couple of
home PCs somewhere in Kuwait and used them as bots to orchestrate a crude,
worm-led, denial-of-service email attack. This predictably led the on-site techs
to shut down and reboot all but the core operating systems required to keep
the station online, conveniently isolating and identifying the masked ports she
needed access to in order to really screw things up.

There was predictable panic at the business end over motive, perpetrators
and what the attack might be a precursor to. Al Qaeda? Iraq? Israel? The
US? Calls were made, denials issued, intelligence sources tapped. Fighter
jets, she later learned, were put on standby in at least two countries. But
while all this was happening, some tiber-geek in Finland, hastily retained by
an oil company, was following a clumsily discarded trail of evidence all the
way back to that notorious global aggressor, Canada.

What do you mean you never heard about it on the news?

Embarrassment stings far less if there are fewer observers, and international
embarrassment is no different. Neither Canada nor Saudi were ever going to
look good over this one, and they knew it would be mutually convenient to
write off their losses and cover it up. Countries did it all the time, though it
was easier when it was unilateral. A couple of months back, for instance, the
US had misplaced a Harrier jump jet, and decided that avoiding scrutiny of
the circumstances was worth more than however many million the hardware
would cost to replace. Lessons were no doubt learned, private apologies and
assurances granted, but, officially, nothing happened, a position that ironi-
cally might have been harder to maintain had they actually apprehended the
perpetrator.

Nobody heard about it on the news, though that didn’t mean nobody knew.
Bett sure knew, like he knew oh so many things, and he knew early enough to
tip her off that she was hours away from being arrested.

Ah, yes, there was a memorable little interlude. Was she ever done wishing
she could experience those fun few moments again, as she contemplated what
some petulant keystrokes had wrought for herself in the big, wide world.
He informed her by email, attaching copies of confidential correspondence,
transcripts of briefings, damage reports, estimates of financial implications,
projected costs of security upgrading and increased insurance premiums. A
lot of very powerful, very important and very serious people would be looking
for retribution over this, and that was just at the Canadian end. It looked
like the last screaming tantrum of her teen years was going to hamstring her
adulthood. She could see college disappearing from the horizon and prison
looming up in its place. She could see a weary and crushed version of herself

released in five to seven, subject to restraining orders forbidding her access
to computers, the one thing in her life that she knew how to make sense of.
She could see a long career in waitressing, serving coffee to the people who
actually mattered, before slouching home to a shitty apartment filled with
laundry and regrets.

Bett had offered a way out. Taking it was only marginally less scary than
what she was already staring down the barrel of, involving, as it did, dis-
appearing from her old life with just the clothes on her back (and doing so
within an hour of receiving the email), but as far as decisions went, it was a
no-brainer. Not quite the career trajectory she’d once envisaged, but things
had worked out a lot more colourfully than the future had looked from her
old bedroom. She had a great apartment in a beautiful village in the south of
France. She had a good job with an excellent salary, plus health and dental.
The only niggling flaw was there was no fixed term of contract and nothing in
the small print regarding how you went about leaving. Oh, and it occasionally
involved killing people.

To Lex’s relief, Som at last stood up straight, the flight case gently righting
itself as he relieved it of his weight. He jumped up and down on the spot a
couple of times and wrapped his arms around himself.

‘I hope this place we’re hitting has central heating,’ he said. ‘Wouldn’t have
to worry if it was a hollowed-out volcano. The top-of-the-range ones have
a pool of boiling lava for the evil genius to dispose of dissenters and broil
burgers at masterplan-launching parties.’

‘This isn’t cold,’ Lex told him. ‘Try winter in Ontario some time. You should
have more layers on too.’

‘I didn’t expect to be standing out here more than a couple of minutes. Plus,
we'll have to change when we get there. Bett would have mentioned clothing
at the briefing if it was an issue, wouldn’t he?’

‘ don’t know,’ Lex replied. ‘Maybe he did. I wasn’t listening. I thought it
was your turn to pay attention.’

‘No, I traded with Armand. I have to pay attention next time. Armand?’

Tm sorry, | fell asleep,” Armand said with a shrug. ‘I’m sure he didn’t say
anything important.’

‘Where is Bett anyway?’ Lex asked.

‘Probably taking a bath,’ Armand told her. ‘You leave that man unoccupied
for any length of time and psshh! He’s in the tub.’

‘Hey, he’s the boss,’ she reasoned. ‘Guy owns a mansion with half-a-dozen
bathrooms. Maybe he figures he’s gotta get his use out of all of them or he’s
wasted his money.’

‘Whatever makes him happy,’ Som said, stamping his feet on the flagstones.

‘He’s Bett,’ Lex reminded him. ‘Nothing makes him happy.’

‘Okay, whatever makes him marginally less belligerent.’

‘He’s got this forecourt bugged, you both know that?’ Armand warned,
casting his eyes melodramatically towards a nearby fir.

‘Seriously, is he around?’ Lex asked again. ‘Because it doesn’t look like
anybody’s home. Or are we meeting him there?’

‘That’s a negative,’ Som said. ‘Nuno’s meeting us there. I’m pretty sure I
heard Rebekah say we were gonna pick up Bett in Aix.’

‘In Aix?’ Lex asked, a little dismayed. ‘This place is in the Alps. If we’re
picking up Bett en route, we’ll be lucky to get there by lunchtime tomorrow.
Are we planning to hit it in daylight, is that the deal? What would be the
point of that? Who the hell hits a place like Marledoq in the middle of the
afternoon?’

‘Maybe that is the point,’ Armand suggested, smiling. ‘Why pay anyone to
guard it during office hours if the thieves and marauders only work the late
shift?’

‘You’ve been around Bett too long. You're starting to sound like him with
that disingenuous bullshit.’

Som rasped his lips and shuddered.

‘Day or night, we’re not going to get there at all if the wheels don’t show
up. Where is she?’

‘Why don’t you wait inside if you’re cold?’ Lex suggested, prompting him to
glance back bitterly at the mansion’s sturdily locked storm doors.

‘Yeah, very funny. But I’m gonna go sit in my car if she doesn’t show soon.
What’s the time?’

‘Seven minutes past five,’ Lex told him.

‘She’s cutting it fine,’ Som said. ‘You know what Bett’s like about punctuality.
“Late is what we call the dead”,’ he quoted.

‘She’s not late yet,’ Lex observed. ‘She was only going to Nice, to pick up
our ride, she said.’

‘She said that much?’ muttered Som. ‘Favouritism.’

‘Our ride?’ asked Armand. ‘What’s wrong with the old charabanc?’

‘Maybe it wouldn’t stand up to her hot driving skillz,’ Som suggested, em-
phasising the z for Lex’s benefit.

Tm not so convinced about that,’ Armand said. ‘Have you seen her in that
new Beetle?’

‘Yeah,’ Lex agreed. ‘I saw her driving out of here yesterday and it was
rocking like it was being boffed by an invisible Herbie.’

‘A bit rusty with the manual transmission,’ Armand mused. ‘Not unusual for
a visitor recently arrived from the United States,’ he added archly, alluding to
the typically shady provenance of Bett’s latest appointment.

‘Yeah, well, whatever her story, Bett wouldn’t be calling her “Transport Man-
ager” for nothing,’ Som insisted. ‘Hey, what time’s it now?’ he then asked.

It’s ...’ Lex started, but stopped herself as it occurred to her that Som could
not possibly have come out on an op minus a timepiece. ‘Why don’t you look
at your own watch?’

‘ don’t want to roll up my sleeve. Too cold.’

‘You're a pussy, Som,’ she told him. A shivering, pitiful Thai pussy.’

‘Thai pussy beaucoup good,’ he responded in a hammy accent. ‘Love you
long time.’

‘It’s nine minutes past,’ she told him, mainly to stop the routine going any
further.

‘Shit. Doesn’t augur well for Rebekah’s first op,’ he stated.

‘She’s not late yet,’ Lex reiterated. ‘Not for fifty seconds, least-ways.’

‘Well, I don’t see any headlights.’

“Maybe her killer skillz let her drive in the dark,’ Lex told him, emphasising
the z herself this time.

‘Shhh,’ said Armand. ‘Listen. Do you hear that?’

‘What?’ asked Som.

Nobody said anything for a few moments, allowing them to hear a low bassy
sound, distant but getting incrementally louder by the second.

‘You gotta be kidding me,’ Lex declared. She stepped further out into the
forecourt and looked around, but saw only black night beyond the avenue of
trees. Still the noise grew nearer.

‘No way,’ said Som.

‘Thirty seconds,’ Armand remarked, standing away from the flight cases and
looking towards the house, from which direction the sound was approaching.

Less than ten seconds later, the black shape of a helicopter swooped up-
wards into sight above the building and circled the property once by way of
signalling intention to land on the gravel. The three of them stepped back
towards the house, Lex taking a moment to rest Som’s flight case down flat
before making her retreat.

She looked at her watch again. The chopper touched down at nine minutes
and fifty-four seconds past five.

‘She’s six seconds early,’ Lex reported to Som above the storm of the rotor-
blades. ‘Oh ye of little faith.’

‘Transport Manager,’ Som called back. ‘Very funny. I guess she meant Nice
as in Nice Céte d’Azure airport, for a charter. Wonder who she hired to fly the
thing. Somebody who can keep his mouth shut, I hope.’

The front cabin door opened and out stepped Rebekah in a black one-piece
jumpsuit, her blonde hair fluttering untidily in the wind where it spilled from
beneath her helmet. She slid open the door to the passenger cabin and strode

towards the flight cases. Given their cue, Lex, Som and Armand came forward
again and joined her in loading their equipment. Directly underneath the
blades, the noise was too intense to allow any verbal communication, so an
exchange of gestures conveyed that everything was in place and they were
ready to board. Som eagerly climbed in first, followed by Lex, deferred to
by the bowing Armand. Rebekah then slammed the cabin door closed and
returned to her seat at the controls. It was far quieter inside, but the noise
level increased again as the blades accelerated in preparation for take-off. A
voice cut across the growing whine, carried clearly over embedded speakers
along both sides of the cabin.

‘Good evening everybody and welcome aboard this Eurocopter Dauphin
AS365N2 travelling to Marledog via Aix en Provence. We will be leaving very
shortly, so please fasten your seat belts and place all personal items, including
handguns, tasers and plastic explosives, securely in the hatches provided. We
ask also at this time that you stow all mobile phones and personal tracking de-
vices, and that passengers with laptops refrain from hacking any mainframe
computer systems as this can interfere with our navigational instruments. We
would like to take this opportunity to say thank you for flying Air Bett, and
that we appreciate you have no choice.’

The stop in Aix was brief, little more than a touchdown. The chopper landed
in a car park on the perimeter of a light industrial estate outside the city. A
solitary figure stood motionless on the black-top beneath the yellow sodium
of street lights, Flanked either side by aluminium cases. Frost had enveloped
all but one of the four cars lined up closest to the abutting low-rise building,
windscreens and bodywork glinting as the chopper’s lights passed over them.

Bett began walking forward as soon as the wheels met the earth, leaving
the cases where they stood. Without prompt, Armand opened the door and
climbed out, moving with brisk but unhurried steps to retrieve Bett’s luggage.
Bett climbed aboard, ignoring Som’s proffered hand-up, and took a rear-facing
seat directly behind the slim partition separating the passenger cabin from the
cockpit. He glanced emotionlessly at his watch: they were dead on time. As
ever, this didn’t appear to be any source of particular satisfaction, though
Lex had nothing to compare it to. Thus far in her experience, Bett’s vaunted
displeasure at ever being behind schedule remained at quantum level.

Armand handed up Bett’s cases to the waiting Som, who stowed them, as
Armand climbed back aboard and closed the cabin door. Then Bett gave the
most cursory hand signal through the perspex window panel to the attentively
waiting Rebekah, and they were off again.

They were on the ground less than ninety seconds.

Nobody spoke, in conspicuous contrast to the relentless back-and-forth bull-
shit between Som and Armand on the flight to Aix. It was an observed silence,
and slightly tense for it. It was always like this when Bett took his place, like
a schoolroom hushed by the intimidating presence of a strict and respected
teacher. Nobody would speak until he did first. Once Bett set the tone, other
conversation could and would resume, if appropriate. Until he did speak,
however, it was impossible to know what that tone would be. He sat silently
as they ascended, impenetrable seriousness in his eyes as he stared out into
the night.

There had been no greetings, nor would there be any checks or queries
as to their preparations. Bett had no need to ask, for instance, whether you
had remembered to bring a particular item, or to reiterate any information.
Armand couldn’t have been less serious when he said he’d fallen asleep during
the briefing.

Bett stirred from his inscrutable absorption once they had reattained cruis-
ing altitude. He glanced around the cabin at their faces, all three meeting his
eye expectantly.

Alexis, boot up, please,’ he ordered, unsnapping his seat belt. He projected
his delivery just enough to carry over the ambient noise, which was louder
than on a passenger aircraft. Bett didn’t like to raise his voice; didn’t like ever
to consider it necessary. It was said that if you wanted people to listen, you
should speak softly. Bett simply assumed people were listening, and didn’t
expect to have to shout to get their attention.

Lex recalled Rebekah’s words over the intercom, echoing the standard in-
flight passenger protocols about laptops. On commercial airline flights, that
only applied during take-off and landing. She didn’t know about helicopters,
or therefore whether Rebekah’s warning was serious despite its humour, but
she sure as hell wasn’t going to refer it to Bett. Any sentence that began
‘But sir,’ was a bad start with the boss. He hated ‘whining’ as he called it,
presumably because it infringed upon his exclusive rights to all grumpiness
and complaining within the company.

She unbuckled her restraint and reached beneath the seat for her kit. Mean-
time, Bett knelt down and slid out one of his cases from the cargo rack, flip-
ping it slightly ajar. She didn’t see precisely what he had removed — a flat
plastic sleeve, possibly a CD — but did catch a glimpse of a row of identical gun
butts nestling cosily in protective plastic foam. A glance at her co-passengers
confirmed they were also sneaking a peak. Bett’s mission briefings were de-
tailed, but seldom comprehensive. There were almost always surprises.

The first one, this trip, was for her.

‘Get into the network at Marledog,’ he said.

‘Sure thing.’

Mid-air hacks were not part of the plan; in fact, she hadn’t been instructed
to do anything more than a covert recce of the Marledoq system prior to the
mission, so there was definitely no need to be doing this at fifteen thousand
feet. She guessed it must have been a CD-ROM he’d taken from the case, and
the contents of it were possibly something that had only latterly come into his
possession. Far more likely, however, was that he simply wanted to see her
dance. He liked to keep everybody on the edge of their game, always ready to
improvise and adapt at zero notice. There was no record in the company of
anyone ever complaining about being bored.

‘Rough skies ahead,’ Lex announced to no one in particular as she tapped
slowly at the keyboard and patiently scanned the screen.

‘What makes you say that?’ Bett asked. ‘You scanning Met office websites
or are you just .... channelling?’ He paused before the last word to give
it emphasis, then pronounced it with a clipped crispness. Bett’s scorn was
seldom far from breaking the surface, but nor was it ever less than elegant.

‘Latency,’ she explained. ‘Connection’s a bit sluggish. Electrical storms tend
to do that to these satellite modems.’

‘Oh, neato,’ ventured Som, gloomily. ‘I always wanted to be in a helicopter
during a lightning storm.’

‘Are you in yet?’ Bett enquired.

‘General network access,’ she replied, ‘but if you want me to start tampering
with surveillance and security systems, it’s gonna take—’

‘No, no,’ he interrupted. ‘I just want you to shut down one of the PCs in the
Security HQ. Can you do that?’

‘Shutting down a PC isn’t going to ...’ Lex stopped herself. ‘Yes, sir, she
corrected.

‘Good. I want you to script something that monitors when it gets rebooted.
Run a clock on it from the moment you close it down. I want a response time.’

‘You got it.’

Lex did as instructed, leaving the response-time clock running in a min-
imised panel towards the left edge of her screen. It would open fully and play
an alarm chime when someone at the Marledogq end turned the machine back
on. She looked up expectantly for Bett’s next instruction, but that appeared
to be all for now. He was staring out of the window again, though there was
nothing to look at but a few wispy snowflakes dancing across the beams of
the helicopter’s lights.

The chime sounded and the clock stopped after four minutes and eighteen
seconds.

‘Log that,’ Bett said. ‘And shut the same PC down again at exactly twenty
hundred hours.’

‘Yes, sir.’

The snow grew gradually heavier as the flight continued. There was no
lightning, but the wind was picking up and the chopper lurched and dipped
with increasing frequency. Lex felt a little nauseous, but wasn’t sure whether
it was as much to do with the motion as worry. This was only her second time
in a helicopter. The first had been eight years ago, a tourist jaunt over Nia-
gara Falls on a sunny July morning, in maximum visibility and nary a breath
of wind. Right now it was December, pitch black, there was a snowstorm
brewing and they were flying towards the Alps.

‘Looks like Lex was right about the weather, Armand said, looking a little
concerned.

‘If we don’t do this tonight, it’ll be at least two weeks before we can resched-
ule,’ Bett stated.

‘Only if you’re stuck on exposing—’

Tm stuck on all aspects of my plan, yes,’ Bett assured him, with the calm
of a man who seldom had to stress his point. ‘But if the weather continues
to deteriorate, it won’t be my intentions that prevail. That will be Rebekah’s
prerogative. In fact, ’'ll just have a word.’

Bett got up and opened the door to the cockpit, reaching with his other
hand into the pocket where he’d secreted whatever he removed from his case.
Through the window panel, Lex saw him talk to Rebekah, then hand her what
indeed turned out to be a silver disc. He returned to the passenger cabin and
took his seat once again, his visage familiarly betraying nothing.

He waited for the next sudden, stomach-knotting surge before responding
to Lex’s eager gaze.

‘Rebekah seems unconcerned,’ he said flatly. ‘The snow is getting pretty
heavy, but she’s not navigating by sight anyway.’

‘What about the turbulence?’ Lex asked.

‘Unconcerned,’ he repeated. ‘I believe her exact words were: “This isn’t
turbulence.” She then added something I didn’t precisely catch, but the gist of
it was that you’d know what turbulence was once we’re above the mountains.
Which should be any time now, I estimate,’ he concluded, fastening his seat
belt with precise delicacy.

Everyone else followed suit, knowing a cue from this bastard when they
saw one.

Mere moments passed before the chopper plummeted like a broken ele-
vator, Lex feeling as though her guts had remained at the previous altitude.
The descent stopped just as suddenly, the plunge bottoming out, rising and
banking into a swoop that seemed to increase their velocity by about fifty per
cent.

Those in the passenger cabin weren’t the only ones to get a cue. Bett
reached his hand behind his head and rapped on the window before grace-

fully flicking his wrist in a gesture that looked like the proverbial royal wave
until Lex realised his fingers were gripping an imaginary baton.

Music. Motherfucker. And a thousand bucks said Ride of the Valkyries.

The music began playing over the cabin speakers a few seconds later. It was
Song 2 by Blur. Lex was set to (privately) deride it as old man Bett’s idea of
cool, but quickly recognised his cold humour at work instead. It was probably
a mistake to think he didn’t know how overused it had been as a soundtrack to
such high-adrenaline moments. The man resonated disdain like other people
gave off body heat.

Som, being less sensitive to such subtleties, simply went for it, and joined
in the ‘woohoo’s as the chopper dipped and soared through the snow-flecked
blackness.

Bett sat expressionless throughout. Lex looked for a hint of a smile or twin-
kle in his eye to betray just how much the bastard must be enjoying this, but
there was nothing. The song played out without him even tapping his feet to
the rhythm.

Then came Ride of the Valkyries.

The snow lightened off over the final twenty minutes of the flight, down to
mere wisps by the time they landed, though it was close to a foot deep on the
ground. This proved of no concern to Rebekah, who expertly set down the
helicopter on a valley floor, some woodland to the north the only feature of
landscape close enough to be visible by what little moonlight broke between
the clouds. Lex saw no lights to indicate settlement, though as Nuno was
waiting for them behind the wheel of a high-sided container truck, there at
least had to be a road in the vicinity. At least, though quite possibly at most.

‘Thank you, Rebekah,’ Bett said, as the rotors slowed and their pilot joined
them on the white surface which was so permafrozen as to compact only a
couple of inches under the weight of their feet. Lex had estimated the depth
at about a foot, and the chopper’s wheels had sunk close to that much, but
it could easily be more. Bett sounded, as ever, like his gratitude, while not
begrudged, was measured out with microscopic precision to be exactly what
was due and appropriate, no less and no more. The sentiment gave off as
much warmth as a dying penguin’s last breath, but somehow inexplicably
avoided sounding insincere or even entirely graceless.

‘De nada, sir,’ she replied.

‘Oh, shit, man, it’s freezing,’ Som complained, while they got busy unload-
ing their flight cases.

‘Appropriate clothing will be supplied,’ Bett said, signalling to Nuno to bring
the truck closer now that the chopper’s engines had powered down.

‘You are a god,’ Som told him, shivering. ‘People don’t say that enough.’

‘No,’ Bett reflected, ‘they don’t.’

Rebekah pulled off her helmet and placed it on her seat inside the cockpit,
replacing it with an elasticated fleece cap. Lex approached, flight case in hand
as she shut the door.

‘Thanks for the ride,’ Lex offered with a smile.

‘Hope it wasn’t too rough. Helicopters aren’t really my forte.’

‘You gotta be kidding. Not your forte? That was some serious flying.’

It’s all in the technology these days. There’s a joke among the civil flyers
that future crews will comprise a single pilot and a dog. The pilot’s job will
be to watch all the computers, and the dog’s will be to bite the pilot if he
attempts to touch anything.’

Civil flyers, Lex thought. As in what Rebekah was not.

‘That’s cute,’ she said. ‘But way too modest. You were hot-dogging up there,
and on Bett’s orders too, I’m guessing.’

‘No comment,’ she replied, failing to conceal a smile.

‘That’s a ten-four if ever I heard one. Where’d you learn to fly like that?’

Definitely no comment.’

Nuno cautiously brought the truck towards the chopper, the vehicle bobbing
and swaying as its tyres traversed uneven terrain beneath the snow. Lex sup-
pressed a smile at the sight of the tall Catalan in this unfamiliar environment,
his beloved dark locks all tucked out of sight beneath a tight black ski-hat.
She couldn’t wait to see how that striding gait of his coped with the underfoot
conditions either.

He veered the truck right as he drew close, allowing him to turn in a wide,
careful arc, presenting the rear of the container towards the new arrivals.
Bett hopped on to the tailgate and flipped a lever, causing the double doors
to open and releasing a heavy steel ramp that slid down to meet the snow.
Lex felt it bite into the ground with a shudder a split-second after the overea-
ger (and possibly borderline hypothermic) Som skipped backwards out of its
way. Nuno trudged cautiously and awkwardly around to the rear and climbed
inside behind the boss.

Bett emerged shortly with an armful of clothing, which he tossed to Som.
From the flail of sleeves and legs, Lex guessed two fine fleece tops and two
pairs of trousers.

‘Get these on. That goes for everybody: two layers each. There’s a box
inside with various sizes. And if you’re wearing anything made of cotton, lose
it before you put these on.’

Som wasn’t about to ask Bett why — you just didn’t do that — but his face
betrayed a reluctance to shed any of the clothes he already had without a
damn good reason.

‘Cotton equals death,’ Lex told him. ‘Cotton holds moisture against the skin
and prevents you warming yourself. Trust me, I’m Canadian.’

‘Are we talking, like, even my Y-fronts here?’

Lex herself had opted for all-synthetic undergarments, but wasn’t sure just
how much outdoor work was going to figure on the agenda. She guessed not
enough for it to matter if Som’s nads got a little chilly. The temptation to
lay it on thick was enormous, leavened slightly by the prospect of seeing his
scrawny little goose-pimpled butt in the flesh. She settled for: ‘That’s entirely
up to you.’

Jeez. Just how long are we going to be out in the snow? How far is this
place?’

‘It’s about five miles,’ Nuno told him.

Just get the fleeces on, Somboon,’ Bett instructed. ‘And if you're still cold,
T’ve got another layer for you here.’

Bett kicked a fibreglass trunk forward across the floor of the truck and
flipped open its lid. Kevlar vests. For all the protection they offered, they
were nonetheless seldom a reassuring sight.

‘Body armour?’ Som asked. ‘I thought this place was all about non-lethal
enforcement technology.’

‘If it was a bakery, would you expect the guards to be armed only with
custard pies?’ Bett asked, with what passed in his case for good humour. ‘The
parent company also develops laser-guided missiles, so you'll be pleased to
know the security personnel are issued with standard Beretta nine-millimetre
handguns and none of Industries Phobos’ hallmarked product.’

‘Don’t suppose there’s any Kevlar balaclavas in there?’ Lex ventured. ‘These
vests aren’t so effective if you get shot in the face.’

Tll be extremely surprised if any of these people manage to get a single shot
off against us,’ Bett stated with absolute certainty.

‘If it’s all the same to you, sir, would you mind if I borrowed Rebekah’s crash
helmet?’ Lex said, only half joking.

‘You can’t,’ Nuno told her. ‘It would get in the way of your night-sight.’

Night-sights. Of course. One of the reasons — though far from the main
one — why Bett was so confident of not getting shot at.

1 eat lots of carrots,’ she protested. ‘I’d prefer the helmet.’

Nuno threw her a pair of fleece trousers and a top, both black. ‘Get dressed,
Lex,’ he said.

Once everyone was suited and bullet-proofed, Bett reached for one of the
cases he’d brought from Aix. He handed everyone a pistol and two mags. They
each slapped one clip into the breech and the spare to their utility harness. It
didn’t look like a lot of ammo.

‘Will this be enough?’ Rebekah asked.

Not if you miss,’ Bett replied. ‘And on that note, let me just stress that I
don’t want any of you staying your trigger hand with thoughts of the poor
guard’s wife and kids tragically impoverished at Christmas. We’ve got a job to
do and so have they. The one who does it best doesn’t need to worry about
his or her conscience.’

Lex checked the action on her weapon. She didn’t need this particular pep
talk. These guys were packing Beretta nine-mills: that was all the encourage-
ment her trigger hand needed.

Som distributed earpieces and Pin-Mics that attached snugly and nearly
invisibly to the inside of their fleece collars. You pressed down on them to
transmit, which was a big improvement on those goddamn sub-vocal things
that broadcast every last unwitting word you happened to utter. Once they
were fitted, Nuno began handing out night-sights. Gadget-geek Som almost
bit off Nuno’s hand to get his first.

‘These the new LS-24s?’ he asked excitedly.

‘Si.’

‘I don’t see what’s to get excited about,’ Lex said. ‘Everything looks like
green shadows and white blobs through these things anyway.’

‘These have a built-in laser range-finder,’ Som told her, his enthusiasm undi-
minished by her failure to share it.

‘What’s a range-finder?’ she asked.

‘It tells you the distance to the object you’re looking at,’ Som explained.
‘Lets you know whether the white blob you can see is a tree half a mile away
or a boulder ten feet away.’

‘Long as the white blob’s not a guy holding a gun, what does it matter?’

‘Tt’ll matter when you're approaching the boulder on a snow-bike at a hun-
dred kilometres per hour,’ Nuno stated.

‘We’ve got snowbikes?’ asked Som, who really was going to regret the mois-
ture retention properties of his cotton underwear if his excitement level got
any higher.

‘MX Z-REVs. What do you think I needed such a big truck for?’

‘Too cool.’

The new toys were dragged from within the lorry on pallets and slid care-
fully down the ramp on to the snow. They looked state-of-the-art and ex-
pensive, the way Bett liked it. Basic instruction was given, accompanied by
some vocal surprise that the resident Canadian and ‘expert in all things win-
try’ should never have ridden a skidoo before. She admitted that she hadn’t
skied before either, politely explaining that no amount of snow could make
eastern Ontario a downhill winter sports paradise due to the place being as
flat as a pool table. To this she added that if you gave her a pair of skates

and a hockey stick, she’d kick all their asses, but by that point Bett was calling
them to order with the outfit’s most peremptory command.

‘A-fag, children. A-fag.’

It was time to get serious.

They rode in darkness. The ZX Rev-Ups, or whatever Nuno had called
them, were fitted with powerful headlights, but such luminosity was ‘contra-
indicated’, as Bett put it with understated technicality, when attempting to
approach undetected. The noise, he claimed, would be less of a concern as
they’d be pulling up a quarter of a mile short, and in darkness no one would
be able to determine whether the sound wasn’t motorbikes on the nearby road
through the valley. ‘That’s if anyone’s listening,’ he added.

It was pretty easy, even if viewing by infrared made the sense of velocity
seem all the greater. Like their aquatic equivalent, it was hard to imagine a
lot of people owning one of these for everyday use. Lex guessed the majority
of sales of such machines were for hiring out to tourists, who didn’t want to
spend a day and a half learning how the thing worked. They just wanted to
push a button, twist a handlegrip and go. She got a real fright the first time
the sled fully left the ground (range-finder or no, her night-goggles failed to
distinguish whether the white blobs of her colleagues in front were gliding on
snow or air), but after a couple more such bumps it became a real rush. Her
only concern was for her laptop, stowed in a compartment beneath her seat,
but with the others setting an unrelenting pace there was no option to ease
off. She was already in the rear of the group, trailing even Armand who was
dragging a cargo sled behind him. They had left a lot of kit back at the truck,
Bett changing arrangements at the last minute as usual, so Lex wasn’t sure
what the cargo sled was actually transporting, but it was having far less of a
braking effect than her caution.

Before folding her laptop closed, she had noted and reported that there was
still no response from the PC she’d shut down back at eight o’clock. Bett had
nodded dismissively in response, like he always did when you were telling
him something he already knew.

They pulled up, as specified, about a quarter of a mile short of the com-
pound, dimly lit against the foot of the mountain by the glow from a few
overhead lamps. There were maybe a dozen cars lined up in a tight grid,
close to where a counterbalanced barrier and a wooden hut blocked access
from the snow-dusted road. The buildings were low-rise and cheap-looking:
windowless warehouses, a prefab site office with darkened wire-mesh win-
dows, chemical toilets, an electrical sub-station. Nothing to see here, they
were saying to any passers-by. The compound was delineated by a wire-mesh
fence, about two metres high. Lex could see a couple of white blobs on top of

the wire that she plausibly estimated to be sparrow-sized, meaning it wasn’t
electrified. Nothing else in her sights appeared to be giving off much heat,
apart from the sub-station.

They parked their bikes at the foot of a small undulation, barely a bump
on the landscape, but enough to render the vehicles invisible from any range
beyond ten yards the other side of it. A heat signature belatedly ambled into
view: a guard on patrol, the sight of which prompted Lex to crouch until she
noticed that she was the only one doing it.

‘Have a look without your night-sight,’ Armand reassured her. She did. The
compound became little more than glow and shadow. Behind her there was
blackness. ‘That’s what he sees.”

‘Gather your goods and chattels,’ Bett instructed, and they each unloaded
what was beneath their saddles. Armand, she noticed, unloaded nothing from
the cargo sled. Lex’s batbelt had a specially designed velcro-fastening cradle
for her laptop, holding it out of the way, across her back. This meant she
was less encumbered by it when moving, but it required detaching the utility
harness altogether when strapping the PC in or taking it out, unless someone
else was there to help. She was asking for just such assistance when Bett told
her to stick the machine back in her skidoo.

‘We won't be requiring any remote access from here on in. If necessary, you
can grab a terminal directly. You do have your tools on removable storage.’

This last was most definitely a statement, not a question. Indeed, she did
have the code she needed on a USB stick, but it wasn’t what was on her laptop
that she was worried about missing. It was the two hundred gigs of free space
on the hard drive. Removable storage was the issue, and whether she’d have
room to store what she intended to remove.

Bett set the pace. They advanced slowly, strung out in a wide line, stopping
two hundred metres from the fence, or 198.678m according to the range-
finder. All but Som got down and lay prostrate, leaning up on elbows to
look ahead. Gadget Geek was about to deploy. He placed an aluminium tube
down in front of him on the snow, then drew a modified grenade launcher
from a quiver across his back. Resting on one knee, he slid the top half of
the tube away from the base, inside which nestled six of his self-designed and
-constructed Flying Eyeballs. He loaded four, one by one, into the breech and
levelled the weapon to his shoulder. Meanwhile, his colleagues were snapping
open hand-held LCD monitors, each about the size of a compact makeup mir-
ror. The Flying Eyeballs, as he had explained (at length, in detail and on an
unwearied number of occasions), were a means of creating an instant, covert
CCTV system without setting foot in the subject area. They consisted of a tiny
digital camera, crucially containing no moving parts, and a lens constructed
from the same synthetic material as prescription contacts. Crucially, because

the device had to withstand being fired several hundred metres through the air
by a grenade launcher, plus the effects of rapid deceleration associated with
being slammed into its target surface at the end of this flight. For analogue
devices and glass lenses, this sort of treatment was largely contra-indicated,
to use one of Bett’s favoured terms. It wasn’t highly recommended for dig-
ital ones either, to be fair, and not all of them survived the trip. However,
their chances were greatly improved by the round rubber housing that gave
rise to the Eyeball part of their name, and more so by being suspended in a
thick, gloopy, adhesive resin inside a fragile outer shell. The shell shattered
on impact, releasing the resin, which dried instantly on contact with air, theo-
retically securing the rubber eyeball where it landed, but in practice working
better on sloped roofs than plumb walls. The camera was weighted and bal-
anced within the Eyeball so that it would tilt and right itself by gravity up to
forty degrees, the lens protected from the resin by a tube-shaped plug that
could be popped off by remote once the device was in place. The only thing
Som had so far been able to do nothing about was the whole thing hitting a
wall or roof lens-side first, which was why he always brought at least a dozen.

He fired off three of the four he’d loaded, readjusting his weight and po-
sition as he aimed at different potential vantage points. Then he scuttled
around to the side of the compound and began again. Lex checked her LCD,
toggling through the views. A lucky night: only one lens-to-wall, one DOA
and two nestled on rooftops beneath four inches of snow. Six shots result-
ing in two functioning cams, giving a pretty good triangulation on the main
paths through the compound. There’d been times when Som had cracked off
a full complement of those things and they’d still ended up going in blind.
She deleted the useless frequencies and toggled between the two good ones.
They had views of most doorways, the sub-station and the guardpost at the
road barrier.

Just one guard so far, said Nuno’s voice in her earpiece. ‘We don’t have an
angle into the sentry box.’

Tvll be manned,’ Armand ventured. ‘It’s freezing. If his boss wasn’t in the
box, don’t you think that guy would be in there warming his toes?’

Lex watched the grey figure on her monitor walking slowly and shiftlessly,
stamping his feet every so often, bored and cold.

‘True enough, Armand,’ agreed Bett. Assume a count of two. We'll take
them separately but simultaneously. Nuno, Alexis, you take ...’

Bett cut himself off in response to the guard suddenly stopping in his tracks,
evidently having heard something. He turned on his heel and began running
towards the sentry box.

‘Fuck, we’ve been made,’ Rebekah said urgently, unholstering her gun.

‘At ease, my dear,’ Bett chided, looking at his monitor. Lex couldn’t make

out what was on his LCD, but it wasn’t the same thing she was looking at;
there was lots of colour, mainly green, as opposed to grey shadows and snow.
‘Quite the contrary, I'd wager.’

The guard disappeared into the hut, from which no alarms sounded, no
lights flashed, and indeed from which he did not re-emerge.

‘Nuno, Alexis,’ Bett said, by way of command.

Lex drew her pistol and flicked off the safety, then back on, then back off.
It was an obsessive-compulsive habit, like trying the doorhandle after locking
her car, and she’d shown no sign of shaking it, no matter how many times
she’d used various firearms. When you were effectively entrusting your life to
a device, you had to be damn sure it was functioning.

The snow silenced their footsteps, only the lightest crunch audible as their
boots sank gently into the unspoiled surface. As Lex neared the hut, she
discovered both that the guards wouldn’t have heard a thing anyway, and
why Bett was unworried by the sentry’s dash to cover. She heard the sound of
a crowd and the excited voice of a commentator. They were watching soccer
on TV, and Bett had known not only that much, but presumably also which
game; that’s what he was tuned in to on his LCD. A goal had been scored, and
one guard had relayed this to the other — which was why he came running.

They took position side by side, a few feet from the doorway, guns each held
in two hands. The commentator’s tones got near-hysterical, accompanied by
angry and then happy/excited shouts from the two marks. Lex looked to Nuno
for the green light, but he took a hand off his weapon and clenched his fist to
signal hold. ‘Penalty,’ he whispered.

There was quiet from the crowd, a collective drawing in of breath. She and
Nuno joined it.

‘Sl vous plait, mon Dieu,’ one guard’s voice implored.

‘Ne manquez pas, ne manquez pas,’ pleaded the other.

Nuno smiled and gave the signal.

Ne manquez pas. Don’t miss.

They didn’t.

Lex and Nuno lay the bodies next to each other on the floor of the hut and
patted them down. She found what she was after in a hip pocket, Nuno in
a zippered breast-pouch. Swipecards, each with a photo ID thumbnail in the
bottom left-hand corner. Low-level security clearance, no doubt, but it would
be enough for now.

She checked her LCD, toggling between the two views. No activity from any
doorways, no further sign of life.

‘Area secure,’ she announced. ‘Clear to proceed.’

Nuno sprung the mags from the guards’ handguns, sliding them into slots
on his harness.

‘This pair won't be needing them any longer,’ he said.

The rest of the team caught up soon after, advancing at a brisk walking
pace.

‘Which building’s the way in?’ Rebekah asked.

‘We don’t know,’ Lex told her. ‘We’re only working from information in the
public domain.’

‘Yeah, Lex, but I thought when the member of the public happens to be you,
the domain gets pretty wide.’

‘Ordinarily, sure, but on this job...’

‘Not in the parameters,’ Rebekah finished, nodding.

‘There are, I would estimate, at least two, and possibly three, entrances,’
Bett said. ‘Two cards, two teams. Knock, knock.’

Rebekah went with Lex, Armand with Nuno. They bypassed the prefab
site-office and the chemical toilet as these had only conventional locks, mak-
ing instead for the low-rise warehouses. Each pair approached, guns drawn,
keeping an eye on their counterparts to ensure that they acted simultaneously.
Lex swiped the card and threw the door open, Rebekah moving quickly inside
and levelling her weapon at shoulder height.

The interior was in darkness. Lex found a light switch and flicked it on,
revealing a room full of stationery supplies, stocked neatly in six columns
of shelves. They were staggered to allow a narrow channel between each,
apart from between the fifth and sixth, where there was a wider avenue. She
walked along and looked down it. At the end, a few yards short of where
the rear wall ran across the rest of the building, there stood two featureless
aluminium doors, a swipe slot to their left. Another storey’s worth of steel
ascended to the ceiling, presumably housing the pulley.

‘One entrance located,’ she reported. ‘And we’re cool for Post-its too. How
about you guys?’

‘Nada,’ Nuno replied. ‘Canteen supplies, I think. Tinned soup. Hey, these
guys really like lentil and bacon. Moving out.’

‘Hold your position, Nuno,’ Bett interrupted. ‘Any confectionery?’

There was a pause.

‘Yeah, that’s a positive on the confectionery.’

‘Snickers?’

‘Okay, let’s see .... Mars, Twix ... Snickers. Affirmative.’

‘Two please, there’s a good chap.’

‘Ah, sir, I think that would count as stealing.’

‘There’s a good chap,’ Bett repeated pointedly.

‘Yes, sir.’

Som and Bett arrived at the stationery warehouse as Nuno and Armand
continued their search. Bett was chewing on one of the appropriated choco-

late bars, his face expressionless despite a glow of juvenile satisfaction. If it
was giving him pleasure, he was trying to keep that to himself, just like the
chocolate.

Lex swiped the card to part the lift doors, holding them open while Som got
to work. He had the control panel out in seconds and began expertly stripping
wires, splitting and splicing with contacts from one of his gizmos, which he
secured to the inside of the panel before replacing it.

‘You're cool now,’ he told Lex. She stepped away from the doors, which
remained open. Som then attached another Eyeball — of the non-flying vari-
ety — to the rear interior of the car, this time a remote-controlled, zoom-lens,
multi-pivoting device.

‘Let’s take a peek,’ he said, pressing a button on the grotesquely modified
gamepad he used as a multi-functioning remote control. The lift doors closed
and a deep whine emitted from the housing above. Lex toggled to the newly
available channel on her LCD. It showed two closed doors, and it showed
them for a hell of a long time.

‘Some depth,’ Rebekah observed. ‘What was this place, a mine?’

‘Nuclear shelter,’ Bett informed her. ‘And before that, once upon a time, a
secret Allied operations HQ.’

The whine stopped and the doors opened, revealing a reception area with
a desk, a row of bucket seats along one wall, a water cooler against another
and two fire doors dead ahead. The lights were on, but there was no sign of
human activity. Som twiddled a hat switch, panning right a little and zooming
in towards the ceiling. There was a CCTV camera staring back.

‘Is that going to be a problem?’ Lex asked.

‘Only if someone’s watching it,’ Bett answered. ‘But let’s assess all our op-
tions first.’

Som brought the lift back, undoing his handiwork and retrieving his gadgets
with the same speedy but unhurried efficiency as he had deployed them. As
he was reattaching the last of his hardware to his harness, Nuno’s voice played
across all their earpieces.

‘Second elevator located. Last warehouse on the right-hand side, closest to
the mountain.’

‘Received,’ Bett acknowledged. ‘And what the bloody hell kept you?’

‘Thorough reconnaissance, sir,’ Nuno replied. ‘It took us a while to find the
lift, but we now know where these people keep their toilet-roll supplies, so if
we really want to hurt them, or this turns into, like, a siege...’

‘At ease, Nuno.’

Nuno had been part of the outfit longer than anyone bar Armand. Lex used
to wonder how many McDonald’s long-service stars you had to have amassed
before you could talk back to the boss like that, but had learned in time that

it was more to do with experience telling you when you could best try your
luck. Bett had no favourites and no formal hierarchy beyond the very simple
one by which he ruled with supreme authority.

Som repeated his surveillance operation on the other lift, intended for trans-
porting freight going by its greater size, grubbier appearance and wider ap-
proach area. The warehouse Nuno called them to had a large loading bay at
the front, served by two padlocked vertical roller doors, each around four me-
tres wide, with the card-op entrance separate, three or four yards to the right.
Inside there was a lot more space than housed the personnel lift, though there
were supplies on shelves around three walls. Much of it appeared to be for
general site maintenance — paint, varnish, detergent, lightbulbs, tools — plus,
as reported, enough toilet paper to keep them going through a nuclear winter.

They checked their LCDs as Som sent the freight elevator grinding slowly
down into the earth. It took even longer than the personnel lift, though most
probably because the mechanism was simply slower.

‘Must have been some deal to carve this place out,’ Rebekah observed, echo-
ing Lex’s slightly discomfited awe at the subterranean scale.

‘A lot of the caverns and tunnels were natural,’ Bett said. ‘Magma chambers,
lava flows.’

Som beamed, his cheeks aglow.

‘What?’ Bett asked, with the weary sigh of one who knows he won’t be
impressed by the answer.

‘You’ve made him very happy,’ Armand offered.

Yes, Lex thought. And they weren’t short of an evil genius either, though no
one was going to say as much.

Delighted to be of service,’ the evil genius muttered, sounding considerably
less so.

Lex’s screen remained black, despite the mechanism having quit its
laboured grinding a few seconds back.

‘Open the lift doors, Som,’ Nuno prompted.

‘They are open,’ Bett answered. ‘There’s no lights on in the freight bay.
Which makes the camera issue moot, wouldn’t you agree?’

‘Unless they’ve an infrared,’ Som suggested. Bett rolled his eyes to indicate
how likely he considered this.

‘Well, on the outside chance that someone has gone to the bother of moni-
toring the camera they’ve got overlooking reception, I think it would be polite
to dress for the occasion. Armand, Somboon, retrieve the security guards’
jackets from the guard-post and go in through the main lift. Keep your heads
down and remember to bin the uniforms once you're past the camera. If I
shoot either of you, I’d like to mean it. The rest of us will take the tradesman’s
entrance.’

eee

No one spoke as the lift descended, the four of them standing with weapons
drawn. Lex felt a cold, sweaty nervousness, the like of which she hadn’t expe-
rienced on a job since the earliest days. No matter how many times she’d gone
into situations like this, she’d never lost that feeling of being hyper-energised,
like all of her senses were at a level normal life had never asked of them. Time
felt both accelerated and suspended, as though standard relativity could not
be resumed until events were at a close and this mode was once again set to
zero. However, this gnarling, dull fear was something different, a chill terror
long-since banished by experience but back tonight, ready to dog her every
step. She knew why, and it was nothing to do with those Berettas.

She flipped down her night goggles as the lift doors ground open, infrared
describing the room to her in subtle differences of tone and texture, all of
it white on green. Shelves, crates, pallet-trolleys and a wide, windowless
double door. They stepped forward slowly, Nuno finding his way first to a light
switch. He flicked it, turning on strip lighting suspended from a surprisingly
high ceiling above. Lex advanced to the card lock and looked to Bett.

Bett signalled to hold, pressing his other hand to his collar-mike.

‘Status,’ he said quietly.

There was no response. Too much rock. They’d be able to hear Som and
Armand again once the pair were down inside the complex.

‘Status,’ Bett repeated several times, at intervals of thirty seconds.

‘Status is we are all troglodytes now,’ said Armand’s voice at last.

Acknowledged. We are holding position in the freight bay. Preparing to
deploy. Any hostiles?’

‘Only Somboon. Ah... okay, I’ve got a layout schematic from behind the
reception desk. Freight bay is on the second level, which puts Security HQ
upstairs from where you are now, downstairs from us. Back-up generator and
power control is in the lowest level. You still want us to...?

‘Proceed with assigned tasks. Remember to smile if you pass us on the
stairs. Oh, and Armand, mess?’

‘No, everything is very clinical-looking. Som’s delighted, I can safely say.’

‘No, I meant mess as in canteen, as in dining area,’ Bett clarified with barely
contained disquiet.

‘Oh, pardon. Oui. Upper level.’

‘Thank you,’ Bett said, with all the appreciation one might expect in ad-
dressing a stone that has finally yielded 0.01 millilitres of blood.

Bett gave the signal and Lex opened the double door, more strip light imme-
diately spilling into the freight bay from the wide corridor outside. There were
doorways along either wall, as well as tributary corridors and a T-junction vis-
ible at the far end.

Bett pulled a fire-exit schematic from the wall and they all briefly examined
it before moving out. Lex dallied a little, allowing Nuno and Rebekah to head
off first, the pair of them charged with locating the staff dining area. She
was hoping she could drop behind Bett also, in order to check on something
unnoticed, but she had no such luck. Bett ushered her onwards in front of
him, making it impossible now to drop back without it being conspicuous. He
would be accompanying her in locking down the Security HQ, so she knew
her window would be tight, meaning she had to be ready to act when — if -
an opportunity presented itself.

The four of them walked briskly on soft feet, proceeding down the corridor
to the end, where they turned right towards where the fire plan had indicated
the main staircase to lie. Nuno went a few paces ahead of the rest, stopping
short of the final stairs to extend a mirror into the corridor on a telescopic
handle. He checked the view in both directions, then gave the signal to ad-
vance. They split into their pre-assigned pairings at the top, approaching each
bend silently and with guns at the ready.

Lex and Bett found themselves at one end of another long corridor, more
doors and passages leading off along the puce-painted walls. The decor was
cleanly and uniformly slapped on to bolted gypsum panels, making it impos-
sible to distinguish where the facade was covering mere partitions or live rock
on the reverse. A grid of white tiles above indicated a suspended ceiling,
housing vents, pipes and cables. It wasn’t much different to a corridor in any
modern hospital or school, she thought, but there was something about the
way it swallowed sound, far more than any lack of a view, that emphasised
the inescapable isolation of the place. Som, she was sure, wouldn’t be dis-
appointed, and like her would be regretting that they couldn’t freely explore
every last bend of this labyrinthine oubliette.

The thought reminded her of what else her itinerary didn’t officially have
a space for. They took another corner, observing cover protocol, though she
could tell Bett was going through the motions for the sake of good practice.
This next passageway took them past banks of glass on either side, allowing
views into darkened laboratories, in which only the shapes of computer moni-
tors were distinct. She stopped by a door and swiped the card, figuring blatant
was less suspicious than furtive. It remained locked.

She had her answer prepared should Bett enquire why she had done it: she
was checking to see what level of security access was on the cards they'd lifted
from the feckless gumbies topside. Bett didn’t ask. His lack of enquiry made
the ensuing silence seem an intolerable vacuum, which meant she had to force
herself not to guiltily volunteer her explanation.

She felt like she was scattering pointers the whole time, and that he must
be seeing her guilty intentions in widescreen. That was merely fear. She had

to hold her nerve. Truth was, she had no idea whether Bett was so difficult to
keep a secret from; this was just the first time she’d tried.

Bett signalled to move swiftly around the next corner. They’d been able to
see into the adjoining passageway through a bank of windows perpendicular
to the ones they were passing, but Lex suspected Bett was getting fed up
playing it by his own book.

‘We could be waltzing through here naked, playing trombones,’ he said,
confirming as much.

‘Permission to discount that image, sir.’

‘Granted. Ah, here we are. At last.’

Lex skipped ahead and took position against the wall outside the Security
HQ doors, one of which was wedged open. She waited for Bett to do like-
wise, but instead he marched past her and straight on in, miming playing a
trombone as he did so.

Lex followed him into the room, a split-level office with a bank of CCTV
monitors along one wall of the upper area, and a row of computers facing the
same direction on the lower tier. Identical screen savers played on all but one
of them, depicting a three-dimensional animation of the Deimos logo. The odd
one out was blank, being the PC Lex had shut down at eight o’clock, meaning
no one had been in here since. She looked at her watch. It read 21:43. The
CCTV cameras all looked across empty corridors, apart from those that were
looking at complete blackness in rooms where the lights remained off. Ben
sat down at the control suite and brought up some different views. More cor-
ridors, more blackness, and one ‘Error: Camera Offline, Lev1/seceNW3/cam1’.

‘Also known as the mess, I’d wager,’ he remarked drily.

The strip lights overhead flickered briefly as she took a seat at one of the
machines.

‘Smooth,’ Bett noted approvingly. He meant the near-seamless switch to
auxiliary power just effected somewhere below them by Som and Armand. If
the main power went down, there was an average three-second delay before
the back-up systems kicked in, which would be enough to put even this sorry
mob on alert that something was amiss. Their trick was to bring the auxiliary
power online first and make the transfer before killing the main grid.

‘Very,’ Lex agreed. It hadn’t even rebooted any of the PCs, which made
a change. The corollary of Murphy’s Law dictated that she wasn’t midway
through an elaborate script the one time a power switch didn’t crash the com-
puters.

Lex restarted the blank one, then glided in her chair along the edge of the
long desk, nudging mice to bring the rest of the screens back to life.

‘ want the duty roster for tonight, Alexis,’ Bett announced, looking at his
watch. ‘And we're going to need it in approximately two minutes plus injury

time.’

‘Yes, sir, she answered with genuine enthusiasm, though not for Bett’s re-
quest. The machines all had users logged on so that if anyone checked the
records it would look like they’d been working — and one of them had high-
level security clearance. The roster was located in seconds. There was no
need to share this with Bett quite yet, however, so she had a brief window
of plausible hacking time while she ostensibly ‘retrieved’ his request. Instead,
she went straight to the access setting and killed the maglocks on all the secu-
rity doors, then jacked in her USB stick and ran a probe through the network
in search of her target.

‘Sir, it’s Nuno,’ whispered a voice in one ear. ‘We have recce’d the mess.
Six guards and three, I think, lab techs. One plasma screen, one Champions
League match in progress, two cases Amstel beer. Nice to see them getting
into the spirit with a named sponsor. Are we good to go?’

‘This is Armand. We are good to go, awaiting command.’

‘The order is on your command, Nuno,’ Bett advised. ‘But let’s give them
until the final whistle. Unfair not to let them find out how it ends.’

‘Youre all heart, sir. Too kind sometimes.’

‘I know. Hang on, how many did you say? Nine?’

‘I can’t be sure. Using the mirror, I couldn’t see all angles. But nine at least.’

Lex knew what he was thinking. It was Rebekah’s first mission.

She held her breath. Opportunity might be about to knock if Bett opted to
go help out.

‘Could do with another gun to be on the safe side,’ he said. Oh please, oh
please. Alexis, you got that roster yet?’

Shit.

She was past the point of no return regards sneaking around behind his
back, but she wasn’t ready to lie to his face yet. Especially not when it was
lying about a small thing that was most suspicious if you got rumbled.

‘Printing it now, sir’

He looked it over, nodding, as it wafted from the printer.

‘Get upstairs to the mess. And don’t stop to smell the roses. Go.’

Damn it.

She grabbed the memory stick from the USB port as she got up, daring a
glance at Bett to see whether he had noted this. He wasn’t watching, still
toggling through security cameras. What was he looking for?

Injury time, he’d said. He was referring to the end of the soccer game the
guards were watching, but it was both literal and metaphorical in this in-
stance. ‘Injury time’ was the term they used when they were tight up against
the clock but didn’t know exactly how long they had left. No one knew pre-
cisely when the referee would blow the final whistle.

Lex charged up a staircase with greater concern for haste than stealth, then
found herself barrelling down more corridors, Nuno giving her a running com-
mentary of directions as she went.

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike, she thought, wryly.
Hacker-speak for lost and confused, recalling a phrase from early, text-only
adventure games.

Nuno warned her she was getting close, so she traversed the last corridor
silently, the sound of the soccer game and accompanying anxious shouts at
the TV spilling from the nearby mess. Nuno and Rebekah were crouched on
the near side, weapons ready.

Lex approached the doorway and gestured with her mirror to indicate that
she was taking a look for herself. She could go sight unseen into a tiny hut
with two guys in it, but nine targets in a large room meant she needed a first-
hand take on the layout. The plasma screen was against the right-hand wall
at ninety degrees to the corridor, the targets sitting around in two rows: one
on aluminium chairs, the other behind, and more elevated on tables. Unused
chairs had jackets thrown over them, holstered guns resting on other table
tops next to the beer crates. It was midweek party night. On the far wall,
at the end nearer the TV, was a long panel of sliding shutters. The assem-
bly sounded increasingly anxious, calling encouragement in near-despairing
tones. Time was running out, in more ways than they knew.

Lex withdrew and took her place alongside her companions. Nuno got to
his feet.

‘On my command,’ he whispered, standing up.

Lex gestured to hold.

‘Did you see those shutters?’ she asked.

‘We tried,’ Nuno replied. ‘No access.’

‘Not any more,’ she assured him.

‘Okay, cool. Let’s go.’

Thirty seconds later they were in position inside the kitchen, standing be-
hind the canteen’s serving hatch.

‘Stand by, Armand,’ Nuno ordered, pulling down his night goggles. Lex and
Rebekah followed suit.

‘Standing by,’ came the response.

Three whistles sounded from the other side of the sliding shutters, accom-
panied by cries of deep disappointment.

Time to put them out of their misery.

‘Go.’

There was no panic when the lights went out, which was helpful. There
were groans and ironic cheers in response, suggesting it was a far from un-
precedented occurrence, and a remark bemoaning that the power hadn’t gone

out earlier and ‘spared us watching that bunch of clowns tonight’. Amid this
hubbub, no one much noticed the sound of the shutters being opened.

They all stayed still, probably in accordance with a safety protocol, and
waited expectantly for the back-up system to restore the light. Down here, the
darkness was total. It was pretty spooky to be standing so close (3.278 metres,
according to the range-finder) to people, to be looking at them, levelling guns
at them, yet to remain utterly invisible to them. Once you got over the ghostly
feeling of disconnection, the sense of power was enormous.

Nuno nodded, and in less than three seconds, every man in the room was
down. Rebekah, as it turned out, found her marks flawlessly. Theoretically
it was no great shakes to hit blind, unmoving targets from close range, but
when it came to the moment and those targets were live flesh, anyone might
choke the first time. No one could predict it for sure, not even Bett, which
was why he’d sent Lex as back-up.

Lighting was restored on Nuno’s order. They angled up their night-sights
and climbed over the counter into the mess.

‘I want a body count,’ Bett ordered redundantly in their earpieces.

The total verified Nuno’s estimate: six guards, three other staff. He relayed
the news to Bett with a concealed satisfaction his boss would have been proud
of.

‘There should be ten,’ his boss informed them all, cutting it short. According
to the duty roster, we’re one lab-rat light. I’m checking the cameras, but no
dice so far’

‘Shall I cut the power again?’ Armand asked.

‘No, that’ll only make him scurry. We’re looking for a labgeek who’s neither
interested in football nor beer. He'll most likely be happily back over his
Bunsen burner now that the power’s been restored. Nuno, Rebekah, Alexis,
take a floor each and find him. Armand, Som, back to the script.’

Nuno sighed, but Lex didn’t share his disappointment. This was the chance
she was hoping for: free rein to wander, nobody on her shoulder.

Tl take the bottom level,’ she volunteered, before Nuno could send her
elsewhere. The brief search time she’d had upstairs before Bett dispatched
her on gun duty had been sufficient to locate which lab she needed, though
not enough to crack the security, otherwise she could have downloaded the
files over the network.

‘Okay,’ he agreed. ‘Rebekah, you take this level, I'll go...’

Nuno was interrupted by the sound of an alarm, its electronic pulsing re-
verberating around every corridor in the complex.

‘Sounds like our lab-geek’s more spooked than Bett thought,’ Rebekah ob-
served.

‘Yeah,’ agreed Nuno. He pinched his collar-mike. ‘Maybe we should rethink
the lights,’ he suggested.

‘That’s a negative,’ Bett replied. Armand and Som have work.’

Back to the script, Lex thought. She headed out into the corridor and down
the nearest stairwell, the noise bouncing around the place in an incessant
blare. Not highly conducive towards concentration, but she’d zone it out,
same as she’d background the possibility of the spooked stray getting hold of
a piece and taking panicky pot-shots about the place. It was now or never.

Alexis, I need you back here ASAP,’ Bett ordered.

Shit.

‘ want this alarm shut down and I need the authorisation codes to stop the
cops coming down here.’

Learning from the main man, and though there was no one around to see,
Lex concealed both her initial angst and her subsequent delight behind a neu-
tral expression.

It'd be quicker if I just grabbed a machine where I am, sir, she relayed,
continuing past the floor Bett was speaking from and making for the deepest
level. Now, she not only had a window to work, but a reason to be at a PC if
the CCTV cameras happened to spot her doing it.

‘You can get the codes from another machine just as easily?’ he asked.

‘That’s why you pay me the medium-sized-but-entirely-reasonable bucks,
sir.’

Lex sprinted towards the specified lab and sat down next to the nearest
PC, waking it from its screen-saver snooze with a nudge of the mouse. She
doubted she could get the auth codes anything like as easily from here as from
a terminal that was already logged on at high clearance, but the fact was she
didn’t need to. She’d systematically — you could even say reflexively — logged
all the auth codes and passwords immediately when she found them, in the
same directory as the duty roster.

Lex plugged in her memory stick and called up the files. She could buy
herself more plausible keyboard time if she held off relaying them to Bett,
but the alarm sound was proving more brain-meltingly unbearable than she’d
anticipated. Presumably in a facility such as this, the intended effect in an
emergency was to make the staff stop at nothing to evacuate.

She told Bett the codes. The alarms ceased a few seconds later, and she
wouldn’t need to worry about his next order for a little while either as he’d be
on the phone to the local fuzz telling them to stand down their response. The
ringing in her ears faded into the deep, still silence that once again enveloped
the complex. There was nothing to hear but air vents and PC fans. Lex took
a breath, blinked her eyes clear and got to work. It took less than a minute
to locate what she was after. The files were encrypted, but she didn’t need to

worry about that just now. She just had to get them on to the memory stick.
She initiated the copy process and sighed deeply as she watched the blue line
slowly grow, crudely measuring the transfer’s progress as file names whizzed
in alphabetical order, too fast to read, across the bottom of the window.

The huge DivX files were last, naturally.

‘I need as many of the research and development files as you can get, but the
videos are crucial. If you don’t come back with those, don’t come back at all.’

Those were his words, the non-negotiable terms of the deal.

She cursed the slowness of the USB port as it drip-fed the data, but she knew
she should have copied the Divx files first, on their own, before anything else.
However, as she was in injury time, she had opted to select everything and
just blob the whole lot at once. Her anxiety was irrational, she knew. No one
was coming down here, certainly not in the couple of minutes it would take
to complete the transfer, but it was the stakes that made it excruciating.

‘Come on, come on, jeez,’ she muttered to herself.

Her ante: going behind Bett’s back.

On the table: walking free of him forever.

‘Bett’s not the only man in the world with contacts. You do this for me and
we'll see whether the Canadian government still cares so much about isolated
acts of teenage exuberance.’

The transfer finally completed, the event unnecessarily announced by a dia-
logue panel with typical Microsoft self-satisfaction. Lex dismissed it then knelt
down and reached behind the box for her USB stick. She heard the metallic
click of a gun being cocked somewhere behind her, and froze, feeling her
insides turn to concrete.

Don’t fuckin’ move,’ said a male voice, angry determination not quite mask-
ing tremulous fear. The accent sounded close to her grandfather’s, though the
choice of vocabulary was not. He sounded close, only a few feet away, and
yet she hadn’t heard him approach because she had all interrupts locked out,
so intent had she been on her business. Her first thought then, upon hearing
the voice, was relief at whose it wasn’t.

‘Get up. Back away from the desk. Keep your hands up.’

She complied, looking along the desk to where she’d left her weapon — not
far out of reach but far enough.

‘Turn around. Slowly.’

She turned, keeping her hands visible but close to her head. She let one
drop slowly to her collar, grimacing as though nursing a strain to disguise that
her fingers were pressing the mike.

‘Who are you people? Hands up where I can see them, I said.’

Lex removed her hand from her neck and faced him. It was the lab-geek,
no question: a little older than her, sandy fair hair, complexion hacker-sallow

from being cooped up in here and not spending much time in the Big Room.
He held his weapon in both hands, a stubby device with a bulky black-plastic
stock and the widest muzzle she’d seen outside of Elmer Fudd’s arsenal.

‘No hablo inglése,’ she ventured, by way of procrastination.

‘Aye, right,’ he retorted. ‘That’s why you were saying “come on” to the
computer? What are you doing here?’

‘Computer no hablo espariol. Me doing nada.’

His eyes flitted restlessly, their focus pinging around between the multiplic-
ity of factors he needed to control: Lex’s gun, his own weapon, Lex’s hands,
her face, her batbelt and the countless possibilities beyond the periphery of
his vision.

‘Answer me,’ he said, his voice lowered to a whisper by dryness in his throat.
He was very scared and for that, very dangerous. ‘Why are you here?’

Td find it easier to answer questions if that thing wasn’t pointed at my face,’
she said calmly.

‘Yeah,’ he replied, beads of sweat forming around his temples. ‘But I’ve a
sneaky feeling you’d be disinclined to answer altogether if it wasn’t.’

‘Could be right,’ she conceded. ‘But just stay cool right now, okay? You gotta
think very carefully about your next move, dude, and I'd advise you against
anything that might seriously preclude making friends with me.’

‘Why the hell would I want to do that?’

‘Because you may have the drop on me right now, but I got buddies coming
and you don’t. The alarms have been deactivated, the call-out to the cops has
been cancelled and we already took out all the security guards.’

‘In which case why would you spare me?’

T could tell you, but you wouldn’t believe me. In fact, you’d think I was just
trying to sell you a line that might get you to put the gun down.’

‘Well, there’s a quality double bluff if ever I heard one. I’ve no idea whether
Id believe you, but believe this: nothing you say’s going to make me put this
gun down. Though seeing as we’re standing here, why not try me anyway.’

‘Okay. We're here to...’

Lex never got to finish her sentence as her eye was drawn to Armand,
stealthily opening the door six or seven yards behind the lab-geek’s right
shoulder. Her pause betrayed him. It wasn’t much, but with her captor’s
eyes locked on hers, it was enough. He turned in response to the noise, swiv-
elling his shoulders and firing the weapon just as Armand was levelling his.
Armand’s right hand recoiled and slammed into the wall next to the doorway,
driven there and stuck, together with his gun, by an issue of thick white goo.

The lab-geek spun back to face Lex, but he’d blown it the second he took
his eye — and his aim — off of her. Lex had changed her stance immediately,
her weight shifted and her hands already in position to grip as he brought the

gun around. Her right hand took his forearm, holding it straight, as her left
pushed the gun firmly and smoothly, his own despairing grip causing his arm
to twist and his balance to lurch in compensation. After that it was a matter
of merely taking one step away to drop him on his back to the floor, that same
step taking Lex closer to her own weapon. She gripped it in her right hand,
still holding his with her left, and pointed it at his chest.

‘Told you you should have made friends, dude,’ she said.

Her knuckles curled around the trigger as a voice sounded in her ear.

‘Don’t shoot, Alexis. Just bring him to me.’

It wasn’t only Lex’s fingers that froze. She glanced away from the sprawling
lab-geek and scanned the room. A camera spied down at her from one corner
of the ceiling. Bett was watching. But how much had he seen?

‘Yes, sir,’ she said, pressing her collar-mike.

‘What is this stuff?’ Armand asked, as he tugged his arm from the wall,
his fingers and sleeve entangled in stringy, elasticated yuck. It resembled
a gigantic gobbet of bubblegum, or ‘the world’s biggest come-shot’, as Som
vividly remarked when he arrived to assist.

The lab-geek said nothing, but the words ‘non-lethal enforcement’ came to
Lex’s mind. She unplugged her memory stick and slipped it into a velcro-
sealed pouch on her harness, then helped the lab-geek to his feet.

‘A moment,’ Armand requested, as she prepared to escort her prisoner away.
He gestured that it was for her ears only, so she drew close. ‘Keep his eyes
front,’ he stated, indicating with his own which direction she ought to be
leading him.

Lex didn’t ask why; it wasn’t a priority. She marched the lab-geek into the
corridor a couple of paces in front of her, her pistol pointed at his back. This
allowed her to steal a glance in the proscribed direction. There was a pallet-
trolley parked further down the tunnel, in the direction of the cargo bay and
the freight elevator. Grey fire blankets were draped over whatever Armand
and Som had been transporting, so Lex didn’t get to see what it was, but at
least she now knew what that extra sled was for.

Lex was grateful to be walking behind her charge, because that way he
couldn’t see that she was almost as nervous as him. Once again, she had
to rationalise. This was just her fear lending Bett absurd powers of inter-
pretation. There was little he could have seen that would have caused him
suspicion: Lex at a PC, tapping away. Even if it was after she’d supplied the
codes, it wasn’t unusual that she’d be curiously poking about inside the sys-
tem; that was what she did. Besides, if he’d been looking at the right monitor
at the time, he would have given her a heads-up that she was about to be
ambushed.

Still, the rush of arguing voices and conflicting possibilities was growing

cacophonic inside her head, which was why she ended up making small talk
with the geek.

‘We’re not going to hurt you,’ she assured him. Just taking you to see the
boss.’

‘Aye, right,’ he doubted.

‘Hey, it could have been worse, man. You could have been watching the
game with the others. You not a fan?’

‘I was taping it. Planned to watch it when I got home. That’s if nobody told
me the score.’

‘No danger from me. I don’t know it. But I do know whatever happened, it
didn’t end well for your security guys.’

‘So I gathered,’ he said bitterly. And how’s it going to end for me?’

The Security and Surveillance HQ doorway stood only yards ahead.

‘Youre just about to find out.’

Lex overtook him and ushered him inside, where Bett was waiting next to
the monitor console, a telephone ready in preparation. He offered the lab-
geek an outstretched hand, which he shook half-heartedly with near-dazed
uncertainty, then Bett told him what he wanted him to do.

Bett hit dial. They heard the tones sound out twice from the speaker before
it was answered.

‘Hello,’ said a voice: male. English accent. ‘Nicholas Willis here,’ he identi-
fied himself. ‘Who is this?’

‘Sir, the lab-geek started throatily. He swallowed and began again. ‘Sir, this
is Ross Fleming at Marledoq. I’m calling to inform you that it’s twenty-two
eighteen hours and I am currently being held at gunpoint by intruders who
have complete control of the facility. Sir, I’m sorry, they just came from—

‘Yes, thank you, Mr Fleming, that will be all,’ Bett said, taking the receiver
from him and turning the speakerphone off. ‘Hello, Mr Willis. Yes, reck-
oned Id better do that in case you thought I was making this call from my
living room. For the record, we had complete control at twenty-two eleven,
that’s twenty-four minutes after entering the subterranean complex, forty-one
minutes after first point of contact at your exterior perimeter and sixty-seven
minutes after landing our helicopter. Indeed. I’ll be putting all of those de-
tails in my written report, along with my full list of recommendations and, of
course, my invoice. No, I agree, it’s not good at all, Mr Willis. Well, that’s at
your discretion, but, personally, my first step would be to fire anyone who is
right now literally sleeping on the job. I'll be in touch.’

Bett put down the phone.

‘Who are you people?’ Fleming asked.

‘What’s called a Tiger Team,’ Lex told him. ‘We were brought in to carry out
a Defence and Integrity test on the Marledoq complex. If you don’t mind me

telling you the scoreline in advance, it didn’t pass.’

‘No kidding.’

Td anticipate seeing a lot of changes around here, Mr Fleming,’ Bett said.
‘Your employers are about to seriously upgrade this facility’s security. ’m sure
you know more than I about precisely why, but from precedent my guess is
you're working on something that certain people might be prepared to go to
extreme lengths to procure.’

Lex felt her hand move unbidden towards the pouch on her harness where
the memory stick sat safe, storing her stolen digital cargo.

Extreme lengths indeed, she thought.


Sports cars and casinos

Jane stopped dead in her tracks when she saw him approaching hurriedly in
the smir under the low, grey, mid-morning sky. It was eleven in the morning,
but passing cars still had their headlamps on and there had been no improve-
ment in natural visibility since the street lights went off two hours before. He
was in uniform, grim-faced as he clutched his gun. She stared, the conse-
quences hitting home, and in that moment her hesitation cost her the option
to hit the deck. He looked up and saw her. Eye contact had been made, so he
knew she was there.

If she’d been more alert, she could have spotted him earlier, she knew, and
taken steps accordingly: changed her itinerary, used her time on areas his
intrusion wouldn’t affect, or possibly just hidden her presence altogether. Kill
all the lights, stay low, wait it out, and he’d move on; then a simple phone-call
to relay the appropriate information would prevent his coming back. But all
of that was moot now. She no longer had any choice but to let him do his
worst.

She walked reluctantly to the front door in her stocking soles, the delicacy of
her imprint seemingly pointless in the face of what was about to be wreaked.

‘Morning. Here to read your gas meter,’ he announced.

‘Oh, sure, come on in,’ she said, faking a smile. It wasn’t his fault; he was
only doing his job. It was just bad timing, really had timing. If she’d held
off on the hall for five minutes, it wouldn’t have made a big difference, or if
she hadn’t just mopped the kitchen floor, she could have called him round the
back door and let him in there.

She led him down the full length of the hall to the cupboard under the
stairs, at the far end next to the living room, where he pointed the gun and
took his reading.

‘That’s me, thank you,’ he told her, then she escorted him back out again. A
matter of moments, that was all it took.

Jane closed the door and turned around, surveying the damage. Two sets of
bootprints, one in each direction, tracked the meter-reader’s passage up and
down her just-hoovered hall carpet. He’d not been particularly tall or heavy-
set, but that didn’t matter: it was all in the soles. Flat spread the weight and

37

left minimum markage, but his chunky, patterned rubberware had bitten into
the pile like a Dobermann, and that Dobermann had drooled, too. Almost
every step was damp on the inwards journey, and nearer the door there were
dark streaks, an abrasive seasonal compound of earth, decayed leaves, gritter-
salt and bark.

She should have let him in the back door anyway, she thought ruefully.
At this time of year, she should always and only let them in the back door.
Mopping the kitchen again would take a fraction of the time, though at the
cost of damp stockings (bare feet not being an option due to leaving prints that
remained visible against the tiles after the floor was dry). The damp stockings
were going to be unavoidable anyway as she had to get to the sink and the
cupboard under it in order to begin working on the damage. Jane looked at
the glistening kitchen tiles. Why was it they only looked that clean and shiny
when they were wet, and why was it that you always had to go back into the
kitchen for something as soon as the floor had been mopped? She could wait
ten minutes for it to dry, she considered, already anticipating the feel of the
cold wet on the soles of her tights, but that was ten more minutes for that
sludgy compound to be drying into her carpet.

Damn it. She took a step forward, bracing herself for the ick factor of
that cold, spreading sensation, then stopped and remained at the edge of the
carpet. For the resourceful operative, there were always other options. Jane
leaned inside, her left foot still outside the door, her right held in balance
in the air as her hands met the island worktop. She tipped herself further
until the edge of the Formica pressed just beneath her chest, then reached
her hands towards the far edge and pulled, her centre of gravity shifting all
weight forwards. Both feet left the ground as she pivoted on her front on the
edge of the worktop, before hauling herself and turning in one movement to
leave her sitting on the island. Good to know all those aerobics sessions at the
gym had a practical pay-off. Drawing her legs up to her chest and spinning on
her bottom, she manoeuvred to the other side of the island, from where she
was able to reach out with her right leg and hook a dish-towel off the radiator
with her big toe before transferring it to her right hand. Thus armed, she let
the towel unfold and dropped it gently to the floor, then stepped down on to
it with both feet. After that, it took only half a yard of the tied-foot shuffle to
get her to the sink, the dish-towel providing a priceless protective membrane
between soles and floor.

Jane ran a basinful of hot water and added some washing-up liquid, before
unlatching the cupboard below, where her heavy-duty chemical arsenal was
stored. So many abrasives, detergents, poison warnings, death-heads, bio-
hazard decals. She often wondered whether, if you put all these cleaning
agents together in the right quantities, you might create something that could

blow half the neighbourhood to Kingdom Come, or even just to Busby.

They should never have gone for self-coloured, she thought, working
carpet-mousse into the fibres with a sponge. It showed up everything; not
just dirt, but each wisp of fluff from Tom’s socks, each discarded snippet of
thread from clothing. Plus, they should have definitely, definitely chosen a
twist rather than a pile that becomes churned-up and streaky if walked upon
in anything more substantial than M&S nylons — and even that is enough
to make it look bumpy and mottled after a while. What use was a carpet
if it doesn’t look good after any modicum of pedestrian traffic? On occasion,
she found herself watching visitors arrive and wishing she hadn’t invited them
because they were about to violate this expanse of laboriously cultivated neat-
ness. Then, once they were inside, her mind was drawn impatiently through-
out their conversation to thoughts of combing it neat again as soon as they
left.

She finished with the mousse and returned the basin to the kitchen floor,
then made for the hall cupboard and her trusty Dyson. Within a couple of
minutes, most of the meter-reader’s tracks had been erased, with only the
damp patches near the door testifying to his having visited. She surveyed this
with the satisfaction she always enjoyed when it had been freshly combed: no
streaks, no imprints, just an unspoilt virgin purity. If only people didn’t then
have to go and walk on the damn thing.

Okay, all of this was daft, she knew. The guys who painted the Forth Bridge
understood that there was no end; like the river below them, their work was a
constant flow. She understood that too, most of the time. Today, for goodness’
sake, she was hoovering every speck, and rendering the place immaculate
when she knew Michelle was bringing Rachel and Thomas over in the after-
noon ~ the pair of them capable of turning the place upside down in minutes.
But she needed, every so often, to restore a kind of equilibrium. It reassured
her to achieve this — the untrammelled carpet, the sparkling kitchen tiles, the
empty laundry basket, no clothes on the horse or in the pile — because if that
equilibrium had been restored, even for a short while, it meant that no matter
what the subsequent disruption, it could be restored again.

And this also, she knew, was daft. Very daft. She had to take a step out-
side herself to see it, however, which was a rarely glimpsed perspective, and
sadly not one revelatory enough to free her. It meant she was still obsessive-
compulsive, but self-conscious and embarrassed about her lot into the bargain.

Obsessing over carpets and laundry. How on earth had it come to this?
Tom said she was suffering some kind of mid-life crisis, though that was in
response to her Private Hire work and her abortive mature student foray into
academia. He didn’t really mean it. It was merely his way of discounting what
she was doing as a phase he was impatiently awaiting her to get past. Men

were good at that; Tom was anyway: filing your activities and enthusiasms
away under Silly Female Behaviour, transient notions of a feeble and ditzy
mind. Bide your time and she'll be back to normal soon.

But what if this ‘normality’ was her mid-life crisis? If so, she’d be ex-

tremely disappointed. She’d always imagined it would take a form consid-
erably more dramatic than involuntary emotional investment in the condition
of her floor coverings, and be precipitated by something significant, remark-
able and halfway interesting. But maybe normality was what precipitated it.
What bigger crisis was there at this late juncture in your life than finding
yourself asking: Is this it?
The ironing, dusting, hoovering, mopping, sponging and re-hoovering com-
plete, Jane moved on to cleaning the bathroom and the downstairs toilet —
temporarily gleaming china representing a few more brief licks on those river-
spanning girders — before continuing her rich, full day with a jaunt to the
shops.

Apart from the major milestones of marriage, parenthood and bereavement,
other people marked the passing phases of their adult lives by the cities they
had lived in, stages in their careers, lovers they'd been with, projects they'd
worked on. ‘Ah, yes, the Barcelona years. Those summers with Theo, before
we grew apart. That controversial tenure with the Philosophy Department.
My Impressionist period.’ Jane could break hers down by supermarket. Early
Eighties: Presto. Late Eighties to mid-Nineties: Tesco. Late Nineties: Safeway.
Early Twenty-First Century: her J Sainsbury period. This last she considered
something of a belle époque, but strictly in terms of the shopping.

Jane had never had a career. A succession of jobs, yes, interrupted by child-
rearing, but never a career. She’d known only one city, and having lived on
its periphery in East Kilbride most of her adult life, she couldn’t even claim to
have known it that well. For more than twenty years she’d lived in the same
house, and for longer than that had had the same lover. Well, the same man
anyway. Projects? At least on that score she could say there’d been two. But
they had both left home now, indeed one of them had left the country, and
neither gave the impression they believed she’d done a bang-up job. On the
plus side, one of them was still speaking to her.

Being just up from Whirlies Roundabout, the Kingsgate retail park was yet
another node in the EK traffic-generation-and-recycling system, but it was
worth tolerating the congestion to shop in a comparatively calm and spacious
environment, especially when you spent as much time in supermarkets as
Jane did. Also, for Lanarkshire, they boasted more than the average number
of aisles not selling oven chips and frozen pizzas.

Jane enjoyed trailing along the shelves and counters, daydreaming about

what she’d like to make if she wasn’t going home to cook for Tom, who
thought that alternating between Indian and Chinese for his Friday-night take-
away meant he had an adventurous appetite. Tom’s favourite home-cooked
dish was stovies, though ideally it would have been cooked in his previous
home by his mother, whose culinary expertise had inexplicably failed to grant
her international acclaim and whose secret recipe for her signature dish had
gone with her to the grave, along with close to a hundredweight of rosary
beads. It said a great deal about why Scotland was perennially referred to
as the Sick Man of Europe that Tom considered home-made stovies a healthy
and wholesome option, as opposed to, say, a deep-fried pizza supper or an
intravenous injection of lukewarm, but rapidly congealing, pork-fat. Consist-
ing of reheated Lorne sausage swimming in a watery stew of boiled carrots
and disintegrating spuds, Tom’s-Mammy-recipe stovies looked like what you
might find swilling at the bottom if a butcher, a greengrocer and a pet-store
shared the same wheelie bin. Jane was of the belief that Lorne sausage was
something people would get into trouble for feeding to animals in ten years’
time, and was pretty sure that in other countries, they wouldn’t even let you
store stovies in the same wheelie bin as normal domestic waste. So, it being
Thursday and her not having cooked it so far this week, guess what was on the
menu tonight? A fillet of that tempting-looking sea bass on a bed of wasabi
mash, with a spinach-and-coriander salsa? Some of that Gresham duck breast
nestling on crisp salad leaves and drizzled with an orange-and-mango reduc-
tion? Or...

‘Half a pound of square sausage, please.’

‘Square? Right you are, missus.’

Jane’s efforts at tempting Tom with more exotic fare had long since been
abandoned. Minor variations on familiar dishes were met with queries as to
whether she’d not been able to get the standard ingredients, and more am-
bitious undertakings had frequently been forsaken at the preparatory stage;
Tom suspecting experimentation was afoot and venturing into the kitchen to
inform her: Tl just have my steak/chicken/fish plain, with a few totties. Save
you all that bother.’

She should have spotted it from the start, and looking back, the evidence
was all there, but when you’re young you sometimes project more than you
actually see. The teen magazines of her youth should have offered less advice
on make-up and period pain if it allowed space to pass on more useful wisdom,
such as a warning that you were kidding yourself if you thought your young
suitor’s less desirable traits would fade with time, while allowing the fairer
ones to bloom. An old-fashioned streak in an adolescent can seem endearing,
single-mindedness a sign of character. Add twenty years and the effect is
considerably less charming.

It wasn’t that he was cantankerous or miserable with his stone-set ways:
what truly alienated Jane was that he was so satisfied by them. ‘Philistine’
was a term people used too freely to describe individuals they considered less
cultured than themselves, even just people who didn’t share their tastes. (The
supreme irony of this, she had learned, was that the original Philistines were
about five hundred years more culturally advanced than the Israelites.) If
Tom preferred stovies to a Nick Nairn creation, that was his shout. It wasn’t
his taste that made him a Philistine. It was that he seemed, as one of her
favourite books put it, content to live in a wholly unexplored world.

The book, The Lyre of Orpheus, was about staging a new opera, from con-
ception through to opening night. She’d read it no fewer than five times,
savouring every word, its pleasures, like all of the best novels, bittersweet
that it was a fiction. What wouldn’t she give to be part of something like that?
Any part: a seamstress working on the costumes; a line-prompt; the libret-
tist’s assistant, transcribing his flights of idea. To be working in concert with
committed, remarkable people, giving the best of themselves to create some-
thing of such excitement and beauty — a fluid, living testament to the peaks of
human aspiration. Who wouldn’t want to swap reality for the world between
those pages?

Answer: someone who'd rather be further advancing his attempted symbio-
sis with a leather armchair while watching endless repeats of Celtic games on
satellite pay-per-view.

She toured the store methodically, threading her trolley along every aisle
apart from the pet-food section, briefly skirting the alcohol selection last, to
pick up more cans of Export for Tom. The shelves of wine bottles glinted
colourfully as she passed them, but, as ever, she wasn’t tempted to lift any.
She also felt a little intimidated by the vastness of the selection, reckoning
you really needed to know what you were doing when it came to that sort of
thing. She didn’t drink wine. She’d had the odd glass of fizzy stuff, but it gave
her a headache, and on the very rare occasion they’d been out for a meal, Tom
just drank beer with his food. She remembered he had once or twice (more
probably once) opted for sharing a jug of sangria with dinner when they were
on holiday in Spain with the kids, but she wasn’t sure whether that counted.
It had tasted like medicine.

Her friend Catherine drank wine. She’d often have a glass or two, some-
times more, when they met up for lunch. Jane never quite caught what she
was ordering, unless it was Chardonnay; she’d heard that mentioned enough
to remember, and had even tried some once. It tasted worse than medicine.
She knew you had to ‘train your palate’ to appreciate it, but couldn’t imagine
herself doing so. Catherine only ordered Chardonnay occasionally, so most of
the time what she asked for sounded like some arcane code, worse than when

Ross started to talk technical. Every so often she would urge Jane to have a
glass, but as they usually met for lunch in Bothwell, where Catherine lived,
Jane would have to drive afterwards. She liked the idea of drinking wine, but
it was the same as she liked the idea of learning to play piano. She suspected
it was a bit late to start, and besides, you'd need to go to night school or
something to learn your way around all those bottles.

Jane headed for the checkouts, habitually scanning along the row. It wasn’t
busy, but she’d have to own up to queue length not being the only criterion
for her choice of conveyor belt. Embarrassing as it was to admit, she preferred
not to be served by a certain cheerful elderly lady, identified as ‘Margaret’ on
her name badge. Margaret was pleasantly chatty and entirely efficient, and
had done nothing to Jane that any rational person could complain about, but
had nonetheless meted out the greatest offence in a passing remark, all the
more wounding for it being an inescapable truth.

Jane had often been at the supermarket in charge of one or both of
Michelle’s kids, for whom Margaret always had a smile and a wave; and when
Jane was there on her own, the sight of a few bags of chocolate buttons on
the conveyor belt would prompt an affectionate enquiry after the wee ones.
It was on one of the latter such occasions that Margaret committed her great
oblivious sin, in response to Jane’s relating her recent success in getting the
weans to take a nap one afternoon while she got on with the ironing.

‘Aye, us grannies ken the score,’ she had said.

Jane could still feel that moment, the sensation of paralysis as disbelief and
denial crumbled, leaving a shattering revelation amid the broken shards of
the illusion with which she’d been deceiving herself. All right, maybe that
was laying it on a bit, but she’d never experienced such a sense of life having
ambushed her since the first time she found out she was pregnant.

Us grannies. She and Margaret, this white-haired and birdlike woman with
false teeth and wrinkled fingers, who was old enough to be Jane’s mother.
It was intended as a show of solidarity, even sorority, but in that moment
Margaret had held up a mirror and let Jane see how the world saw her. In
that mirror, she looked like Margaret. Us grannies ken the score.

Jane had technically become a generation older the moment her first grand-
child was born, three years ago, but Margaret’s remark was the moment when
she belatedly felt it. At the time of Rachel’s birth it hadn’t meant anything:
she knew she hadn’t got any older and it was still the same face in the mirror.
Her thoughts had only been of joy at the sight of her granddaughter, tinged
admittedly with a few concerns about Michelle, only twenty-two and follow-
ing in the missteps of her mother, who’d found herself in the same position at
nineteen.

She was forty-six now, forty-three when Rachel was born. There’d been lots

of jokes about her being a granny and applying for her bus pass, but she’d
happily laughed it all off because she still considered herself young. Being
a grandmother at forty-three didn’t change the fact that she was forty-three,
any more than it had altered the status of her school friend Jennifer when she
became an auntie at the age of nine. Forty-three was still young. Forty-six was
still young. You’re only as old as you feel, ran the cliché. She’d known people
who'd been in their fifties since they were adolescents — she had in fact been
foolish enough to marry one. Age was merely chronology. She knew what
being young meant. It meant that life still had plenty in store for you; maybe
even that it still had more in store for you than you'd already experienced.
It meant there was still time to do all those things, whatever all those things
might be.

Margaret’s remark hit her so hard because it forced her to realise that by
this, her own definition, she was no longer young, nor had she been for some
time. She felt pulled forward in some temporal vortex, at the end of which
she was sitting there, white-haired, bird-like, with false teeth and wrinkled
fingers, never having done any of those things. There was no time, and life
had little in store but more of the same. Suddenly she was in the third act, the
beginning of the end. Us grannies ken the score: we’ve had our whack. This
is it.

When Jane was a girl, it felt like the greatest treat when there was a James
Bond film on TV on a Sunday night, an epic adventure that made school the
next day seem a long way off. The Sixties ones were best, with Connery,
but even OHMSS was a fantastic escape. It didn’t matter about Lazenby be-
cause, unlike her brothers, she wasn’t watching them for James Bond. She was
watching them because they were like a two-and-a-half-hour holiday, a tour
of enticing locations and a vicarious glimpse of a lifestyle that was a world
apart. Scuba-diving in the tropics, skiing in Switzerland, chateaus, mansions
and hotels. One day, Jane Bell had always dreamed, she would go to a casino
on the French Riviera, dressed in something you'd get lifted for in Glasgow,
and she’d arrive there in a convertible classic sports car. It wasn’t a yearning
for riches, for money (although, as her mother used to say, it came in handy
when you were paying for the messages); it was a yearning to prove she could
be that woman, who could wear that dress, drive that car and walk into that
casino. And Jane Bell could have been that woman, she was sure, but she
wasn’t Jane Bell any more. She had become Jane Fleming, and Jane Fleming
ken’t the score.

Jane got pregnant when she was nineteen. She’d wanted a lot more from
life than even her Riviera fantasies before that happened. It was just before
the third-term exams in her first year at Glasgow Tech, two generations and
a lifetime ago. She was studying engineering, one of very few females doing

so at the time, but having grown up in a house with three older brothers, she
was used to the ratio and all that went with it. They were exciting days, and
not just for the usual reasons of adolescent liberation. The cultural insurgence
that was Punk was well under way, and with it a sense that nothing couldn’t
be changed; everything was finally up for grabs in an ailing and long-stagnant
society. The meek acceptance that everything was in the clutches of an older
generation and a higher caste was being noisily trashed. That’s what the
purple Roneo-copied fanzines said, anyway. Almost everyone she knew was
‘starting a band’, even if for many the declaration of intent was as important
a statement as any music they may or may not ever get around to playing.

Jane wasn’t much of a rebel. She got on well with her parents, for a start.
They were kind to her and she liked to please them in return, liked to see them
happy with her, their one little girl after three rowdy boys. She liked pleasing
them as she liked pleasing people in general, hideously uncool as that was to
admit. She’d been brought up to endeavour to do what was right, whether
that be working hard at school to get good results or going the messages
for old Mrs Dolan next door. John Lydon would have had her ceremonially
thrown out of that SPOTS gig if he’d had any idea of what was in his midst.
Jane wasn’t out to change the underlying social order. She was just intoxicated
by the energy of it all, of youth fearless and unfettered. She cropped her hair
short and dyed it blue. She mutilated this old red tartan frock of her auntie’s
to make a two-part tabard and mini-skirt affair. The top half was barely held
together down the sides by safety pins and hairy string, while the bottom
provided minimal cover but maximum contrast against her preferred Day-Glo
green tights. She still had a photo somewhere. She looked shocking, awful,
ghastly. But in a truly magnificent way.

There was a comic song around that time, the B-side of Andy Cameron’s
doom-tempting World Cup single, called I Want to Be a Punk Rocker but Ma
Mammy Wullnae Let Me. Jane guessed that could well have been her, had it
not been that her mammy did let her. Her mum had already been through a
few pointless losing battles with her eldest brother, Billy, over long hair, a skin-
head, long hair again, flares, platforms and Slade gigs. If Jane had stopped
going the messages for Mrs Dolan or tidying her bedroom of a Saturday morn-
ing, that would have caused more censure and concern. She feared she was,
in the words of another song of the time, a part-time punk, but in that she
was hardly alone. It being Glasgow, a familiar cry around the family hearth of
a Saturday afternoon would have been: ‘Haw Maw, gaunny iron ma bondage
troosers fur the night, pleeeease.’ It wasn’t about changing the world; it was
about being nineteen.

She called herself Blue Bell, in reference to her hair. She and her pals
all had these punk names for themselves. Suzi Spiteful, Tina Toxic, Corpse-

Boy, Venom, Bloodclot. She remembered two old punters behind them on a
bus into town one night, listening with growing amusement at their names.
‘Whaur’s Biffo?’? one asked the other. ‘Is that Biffo next tae Korky and
Gnasher?’

She saw The Clash, The Damned, The Buzzcocks, and of course SPOTS —
Sex Pistols On Tour Secretly — this last via a very drunken six-hour transit-van
trip to Middlesbrough. Casinos and sports cars weren’t high on her wish list
at that time, any more than a newbuild in EK with a husband and a baby. But
guess what?

For someone with dreams of distinguishing herself, of living a life that was
remarkable, was there any greater failure, anything more embarrassing, then
ending up a cliché? There were various ways of relating the tale, slants and
spins that could be put upon the details, but the most important facts didn’t
change: she got pregnant, had to drop out of college and was railroaded by
her circumstances into marrying the guy. The only way she could have topped
that would have been if the fateful encounter had been her first time, but it
wasn’t. It was just her first time with Tom and her first time without a condom.

Tom was a friend of her brother Steven, who knew him from the College of
Building and Printing. He was twenty-one but seemed older, certainly more
mature. He’d gone to college at seventeen so by twenty-one had graduated
and was working in his first job as a surveyor. He had disposable income and
his own car, which would have made him an attractive prospect even if he
wasn’t good-looking, but he was, albeit in a rather serious way.

He wasn’t a punk (a real waste given that Flem was a ready-made nick-
name), but he did seem to like the music and could afford to buy more of
the records than Jane or her crowd. He came along to a few gigs and dis-
cos, dressed in drainpipes and a leather jacket, but could hardly go the full
bhoona, with hair and piercings, he explained, because he still had to turn up
to places in a suit on Monday morning. Jane suspected Tom would never have
been going the full bhoona anyway, but didn’t particularly mind. Going out
with him, she felt she was getting the best of both worlds. She had her punk
pals to be daft, outrageous and generally irresponsible with, and, on the other
hand, she had a sensible and mature boyfriend, with prospects and money in
his pocket, who made her feel grown up in a way every young woman en-
joyed. His serious side was a welcome contrast with her other crowd, and
it actually felt quite flattering that someone like that didn’t see her as a silly
wee lassie. What he did see, she wasn’t so sure of, but she didn’t give it much
thought. At that age, you don’t ask these things of yourself. You just go out
until it stops being fun. When you’re truly young, you feel like the present
is forever. That’s why you don’t see the future careering towards you like a
runaway eighteen-wheeler.

Before going out with Tom, Jane had sex with two boyfriends plus two
one-night stands, both times drunken ‘friend-sex’ encounters with guys in the
punk crowd. The punk scene had been derided as sexless and John Lydon’s
withering remark about ‘two minutes of squelching noises’ was often quoted
in support, but only, Jane suspected, by green-eyed chroniclers on the outside
looking in. Sexless? Take adolescents in ripped clothes, add music and liberal
doses of cheap alcohol. What do you think you’re going to get? The tabloid
reporters with their hackneyed seaside-postcard idea of what constituted sexy
couldn’t get their heads around the fact that they weren’t dressing to attract
the opposite sex. They were — girls and guys — dressing to express themselves,
and as far as she was concerned, nothing was sexier than that.

Sex at that age felt like another youthful freedom, another new area for
exploration, for expression, for fun. Meaningless? Maybe. Serious? Never.
Then along came Tom and it suddenly became a psychological minefield, each
minor advance in how far she could tempt him to go followed by a ghastly
spectacle of guilt and self-recrimination.

Jane’s family were nominal Prods but actually not religious. Perhaps if they
had been, she’d have known a little better what she was dealing with, before
Catholicism notched up another pyrrhic victory by punishing ordinary human
behaviour.

Tom wouldn’t accede to her request, even couched in his own words, to
wear a condom ‘in case things go too far’. His otherwise cautious and sensi-
ble rationality was obliterated by a combination of primitive superstition and
plain old denial. The logic ran thus: the big beardy punter in the sky forbade
contraception, and wearing a johnny ‘just in case’ would only make going too
far that bit easier. This part she couldn’t argue with; indeed was counting
on to get him past this stupidity. His counter-logic, however, was that not
wearing a condom would therefore constitute an insurmountable deterrent.

In the words of the wee schoolboy, upon being told by his teacher that
there was no example in the English language of a double positive expressing
a negative, ‘Aye, right.’ When religion attempted to play the immovable object
to human sexuality’s unstoppable force, there could only ever be one result.

The A word loomed large in her head, filed under Easy Way Out. Toxic
Tina’s older sister had had one. She could get it done before anyone found
out. But ‘before anyone found out’ was always going to be a short window
of opportunity, and it proved not to be one she was decisive enough to take.
The catch-22 was that aborting was something she could only go through
with before anyone close to her found out, but she couldn’t go through with it
before talking to someone close to her. She wasn’t the most politicised student,
but she knew where she stood on a woman’s right to choose: she’d signed the
petitions, been to the meetings, worn the badge, and she’d do the same today.

But at that most lonely and vulnerable time, her squeamishness at the thought
of something growing inside her was topped only by her squeamishness at the
thought of somebody taking it out.

Her parents were as supportive as she could have possibly hoped, and in
that respect she knew she’d been extremely fortunate. Matters were discussed
openly and pragmatically, but she still got the sense that summit meetings had
been taking place above her head. Marriage, therefore, was more arrived at
by consent than proposed. There was no going down on one knee and, then
at least, no ring. Tom offered because he was dutiful, responsible and caring,
and because he believed it was the right thing to do. There was also the fact
that his parents would rather see him burned at the stake than be father to
an illegitimate child — and a Proddy one at that — but her own mum and dad
made it clear to all that it would be Jane’s decision and hers alone.

She was so, so young. Marriage was for proper grown-ups, not kids like
her. But then so was motherhood. Tom was decent, attractive, had a good
job, money in the bank and she knew he’d look after her. What more could
she ask for, in her circumstances? It wasn’t how she’d pictured this moment
in her life, but it wasn’t the end of the world; just the end of a world and the
beginning of a new one.

Fast-forward three years and it was a far better world than she could have
imagined. She had two lovely children, Ross then Michelle, fourteen months
apart (she had her tubes tied after the latter given that Tom still wouldn’t
countenance any form of birth control), a nice house, holidays abroad, even
her own car, Tom’s promotion earning him a company one. A glimpse at
how her old pals were doing showed her where she could have been had she
finished her studies, and it looked like she had been the one who struck it
lucky. It was the early Eighties, Thatcher was in power, nobody had a job and
everyone was skint, still living like students in bedsits or in many cases back
with their folks.

On the whole, she knew she had it good; but though she had few com-
plaints, that didn’t mean she was without regrets. There wasn’t much prospect
of a career, for one. Even once the kids were both school-age, the hours be-
tween dropping them off and picking them up were rapidly filled with shop-
ping, cleaning, ironing and cooking, leaving no scope for anything other than
part-time work. It was something she accepted, but never entirely made her
peace with. She enjoyed being a mum and she loved her kids, but from time
to time felt this guilty admission that she still wanted something more. Not
something else, just something more. Was that such a heresy, to admit that
your love for your family wasn’t sufficiently all-consuming as to extinguish all
other desires? Did it mean she wasn’t cut out for this? And did any other
mothers feel this way too? None that were owning up to it, but that didn’t

mean she was alone.

As the years passed, though, she found herself rationalising many of her
own dreams away, and having dreams for her kids instead. These proved no
less a source of frustration, but at least helped her see how daft some of her
own notions had always been. Sports cars and casinos were just a wee girl’s
fantasy, but they had endured in her mind as icons that had come to represent
another self she could yet aspire to be. They symbolised her belief that she
was still young, that she could still do something more with her life, one day.

Going back to college, for instance. That was meant to be the big new
beginning. She had no inclination to resume her original studies, instead
deciding that someone who had read as many books as she ought to have a
crack at English Literature. She applied to Glasgow Uni and received an offer
conditional upon topping up her qualifications, including an improved and
more up-to-date Higher English. This meant a year of night classes, which
was no hardship as it regularly got her out of the house and away from half-
man-half-armchair and the relentless tyranny of Sky Sports. Having waited
this long to restart her life, what was another year? Well, another year was
time enough for Michelle, who’d graduated from Strathclyde in Pharmacy
and was working at the Royal Infirmary, to meet Doctor Right, marry him and
conceive their first child.

Jane tried not to dwell on the rather mocking sense of déja vu when she
calculated that Michelle was due around about third-term in her first year as
a mature student, and pressed ahead with her studies. She sat — and passed —
her exams, amid the considerable distraction of Rachel being born, then en-
joyed a long summer, during which it became clear that she was indispensable
to her daughter. And if there was any doubt in her mind where her respon-
sibilities lay, Michelle getting pregnant again, before the autumn leaves fell,
dispelled it utterly.

This time she had no regrets. It put into perspective what was important,
and besides, she told herself, there was still time for .... whatever. Michelle
planned to go back to work after the second baby, so both the kids would
be going off to nursery when they were two. Jane was only forty-three that
autumn. She was still young; life had plenty left to offer. She’d resume her
degree one day, along with whatever else she wanted to embark upon. Broad-
ened horizons, new beginnings. One day.

Michelle did go back, taking a job at Hairmyres Hospital once Thomas had
started nursery. That was about six weeks back, just before Margaret laid
down that inescapable truth which, deep down, Jane had known all along.

There is no ‘one day’. There is only today, and today wasn’t about sports
cars or casinos or degrees or new beginnings. Today was about hoovering the
carpet, trailing round the supermarket and cooking stovies, before vegetating

mindlessly all evening in front of the TV next to a man she still lived with only
because neither of them had anywhere else to go.

Us grannies ken the score.

Aye. We lost.

The specialist
Lex was stirred from her daydreaming by the sensation of the chopper losing
altitude. She’d been watching the rain streak the window to her left, there
being nothing else to look at as they’d been flying through cloud for the past
ten minutes.

‘T’ve always wanted to ask, how do pilots know where they’re going when
they can’t see twenty feet in front?’ she enquired of Rebekah, sitting to her
right at the controls.

‘Navigational instruments and the altimeter let you know where you are.
You don’t think in terms of what’s directly in front — it’s not like driving a
car. You think in terms of what’s five miles in front. It’s all about vectors and
trajectories.’

‘Yeah, I got the navigational concept. But how does thinking in terms of five
miles in front help you avoid some other sky-borne object that’s a hundred
feet ahead inside the cloudbank, or when it’s pitch-black outside?’

‘Oh, that’s generally where air traffic control comes in. Flights are all
logged, airspace allocated — you got corridors at different altitudes.’

‘Generally? What’s the exception?’

Rebekah smiled. ‘Unofficial, unauthorised aircraft flying at ultra-low alti-
tude to evade the ATC systems and thus remaining off the charts.’

‘Damn, I hate it when I know what you're about to say. And what do those
aircraft use?’

Rebekah laughed. ‘Radar, what else? You see that panel there?’

Lex looked at the little LED screen where Rebekah was pointing. She un-
derstood the principle but was neither impressed nor assured by the lack of
detail. There was a white triangle in the centre, picked out against the blue
background, two arrows flanking it, each above two decks of numbers.

‘Anything in the sky within range will show up, with its altitude and velocity
cited beneath the blip. Quit worrying just because you can’t see tail lights or
lines on a highway. You're only seeing clouds because you're only looking at
clouds.’

‘T think [’'d want something more than a tiny blinking light to let me know
there was a Seven-Forty-Seven bearing down on us at five hundred miles per

51

hour. What are you seeing?’

‘Clear passage to our refuelling stop, ETA three minutes.’

‘Okay. Just as long as you're also seeing pylons, steeples and cliff faces.’

‘Relax. We’re not as low as you think. Just wait for the second leg if you
wanna see low.’

Lex slammed her head back against the seat and sighed. ‘Scroll up to my
previous entry re knowing what you're about to say.’

‘Oh, grow a spine, girl. We’re still in French airspace. We haven’t even done
anything illegal yet, never mind dangerous.’

‘What about flying unlogged and unauthorised below ... etcetera etcetera?’

I was pulling your chain. This part of the flight is logged and authorised.
It’s the next part that won’t be.’

‘So we haven't flown below ATC radar yet? Oh God, don’t answer that.’

‘Scroll up yourself, I already did.’

‘And you actually relish the prospect of flying over the North Sea at roughly
the same altitude as a skimming pebble?’

‘Not a whole bunch, but I relish it more than the prospect of being escorted
to an airbase by RAF fighter pilots armed with heat-seeking air-to-air missiles.’

‘Copy that,’ Lex agreed.

They touched down on schedule. Having descended through a grey abyss
of cumulo-nimbus, it was a relief to finally emerge into clear air, even if there
wasn’t so much of it between them and terra firma. Rebekah landed the bird
close to a hangar at a small private airfield, then killed the engines and waited
for a fuelling truck to make its way across the runway from next to the flimsy-
looking office building.

Lex stepped outside to get some air. There was a light drizzle blowing
around so she didn’t stay long, but she needed a few moments’ wandering
where it was cool, with some wind in her face and her feet on the ground.
She’d never been scared of flying before, nor would she say she particularly
was now, but her perspective upon it had changed in recent months since
riding up in the cockpit with Rebekah. She’d never felt quite so safe again in
any car after her first driving lesson, suddenly bereft of the protective illusion
afforded by complete ignorance. Obviously she’d never been allowed to take
the controls of the helicopter, but simply being up in that thing with Rebekah
had caused the same effect: the magic spell had been broken.

That, however, only accounted for a fraction of her anxiety about this trip.
In fact, the moments of visceral terror awaiting her on their low-level scoot
across the English Channel and the North Sea would at least provide momen-
tary vacations from worrying about everything else.

‘You okay?’ Rebekah asked, having docked the fuel hose and given the go-
ahead to the truck-driver to start the pump.

Lex nodded.

‘tll be cool,’ Rebekah assured her. ‘These things practically fly themselves.
So much technology. One pilot and a dog, remember?’

‘I remember. And it makes me think about what we in the computer world
call the Airplane Rule: a twin-engine airplane has twice as many engine prob-
lems as a single-engine one. Complexity increases the possibility of failure.’

‘Good job we aren’t flying in an airplane, then, huh?’

‘Oh yeah. I’m sure the principle doesn’t apply to egg-beaters. How many
engines does it have?’

‘Two,’ she admitted with a naughty-little-girl grin.

Figures. Tell you the truth, though, the aircraft and the sub-radar low-jinks
don’t have me worried as much as the reason we need all that.’

‘Well, I know the etiquette about personal questions, but I’m guessing you
don’t want to end up being questioned by the British authorities any more
than I do. The sub-radar low-jinks are the price we pay for secrecy. What’s
wrong with that?’

‘The secrecy angle is covered. Look at the documentation we’re carrying:
fake passports, drivers’ licences, credit cards - complete ID work-up. We could
both make this trip on commercial transport under assumed identities and no
record would show that Alexis Sinclair Richardson or Rebekah Kristine Bardell
were ever here. The reason we’re doing it under the radar is that Air Bett
is less antsy than the commercial carriers about itty bitty things like toting
handguns and live ammunition on board their aircraft.’

‘Maybe you'll tell me different, Lex, but I can’t imagine you'd feel better
about walking into this thing without a gun.’

Tm pretty certain I’m carrying it for more than reassurance. That’s what
I’m nervous about. It would have been cheaper, simpler and safer to stick me
on a plane. Bett sent me this way, with you, on a private helicopter, under
the radar, so that when I got there I’d have a gun in my hand. That’s a lot of
trouble for just-in-case.’

‘No, Bett sent you this way, with me, on a private helicopter because he has
a private helicopter and a trained pilot at his disposal. He did it because he
can, and thus it’s the simplest solution. No disrespect, Lex, but if Bett really
thought we were heading for a shooting match, do you think he’d have sent
you and not Nuno?’

Lex had to concede the point. Rebekah was right about this, just like she
was right that the flight would be cool; terrifying, but ultimately cool. Unfor-
tunately, it was actually neither of these things that had Lex’s guts in spasm,
her brain dropping packets and her eyes looking over her shoulder. They were
merely plausible explanations to offer Rebekah when she noticed.

Truth was, Lex had been suffering from a feeling of impending disaster since
the moment this mission began, and nobody could reassure her over her fears
because for anyone to know what she was afraid of would require the worst
of them to have come true.

In fact, the feeling had started before she even knew what the mission was,
when Bett turned up unheralded at her apartment. Bett, to her knowledge,
never turned up unheralded at anyone’s apartment. If he needed you tout de
suite, he paged you and you went to him, right that second, no matter where
you were, what time it was, who you were with or whether you’d come yet.
If for any reason he needed to visit you at home, it was the same drill, and
you had, on average, about ten minutes to get ready. Whether you spent that
time putting on some clothes, tidying the place or improvising an explanation
to erstwhile lovers and inebriated houseguests as to why they had to leave
the building at four in the morning was entirely up to you. For him to just
show up and ring the doorbell was unprecedented and uncharacteristic, both
of which she took as surely indicative of only one thing.

She had been working on the procurement of some electrical schematics
and architectural blueprints pertaining to the vault and safety-deposit box
galleries of a bank in Lisbon. They weren’t planning any practical demon-
strations; she just had to report on how much technical information she was
able to acquire and what level of expertise had been necessary in doing so.
The answers at that point would have been, respectively, ‘Not much so far,’
and, ‘More than this lamer has been able to exercise,’ with a rider that things
might look different in a few hours if she could get this crufted-together code
she was wrestling to do the needful. Consequently, she was in what real pro-
grammers called deep-hack mode - interrupts locked out — when Bett rang
her bell. This, in fact, meant he had to ring her bell four times before she was
drawn sufficiently close to the surface as to be able to hear it. Naturally, he
was not delighted by the delay, though the displeasure in his face was nothing
compared to the revulsion he must have seen staring back in hers. Happily,
he’d seen the depressurisation-trauma effect of her being peremptorily yanked
back from deep-hack mode before, and assumed that this was all he was see-
ing, thus failing to register her genuine terror and conspicuous guilt at the
mere sight of him standing in her lobby.

There’d been a number of ‘This is it’ moments since her act of moonlight
freelancing on the Tiger Team job at Marledoq. The instances had depleted
with time, beginning with the paranoid expectation that Bett’s every greeting
was an overture towards challenging her about her deception; then graduat-
ing towards making the same assumption only when he did something slightly
unusual, such as compliment her work or offer her a smile. With three months
having passed, her more rational side was starting to hold sway in its bid to

convince her that if Bett knew anything, he’d have done something about it
by now. Her less rational, but defensively cautious, side was nonetheless still
aware that Bett was the kind of calculatingly twisted individual who might
keep his powder dry — and his transgressor in excruciating suspense — before
finally meting out punishment just when she thought she was in the clear.

Up until then, Marledoq had borne no consequences, least of all the ones
she’d bargained on. Yeah, why wasn’t that a surprise. She’d been way too
eager to grab at the bait, and once the deal was struck had thereafter been
more worried about how she was going to pull off her side of it than about
whether she was ever likely to see the reciprocal back-end. Man, did she ever
walk into that with her pants down and her wallet open. She’d known it,
truly, deep down: face it, girl, when she went to that hand-over she’d have
been surprised if she was sent away with anything more than ‘Thanks’ and ‘T’ll
call you’. But still she’d needed to try. Maybe it was an act of faith and maybe
it was just an act of defiance, but she’d been compelled to give it a shot.

And she’d done it, too. That was what made her feel so dumb about walking
away empty-handed. She’d been smart enough to acquire the files, but not
smart enough to make the most of it once she had them. Why did she just
cough up like a good little girl? Why didn’t she play hard, or even halfway
cute? ‘Sure, I got the memory stick, but you don’t get your hands on it until I
see something more than a promise in return.’

Yeah, right. Like she could have pulled that shit off. He’d have laughed in
her face, then probably killed her and raided her apartment to get what he
needed. In that respect, she was actually kind of relieved that nothing further
had come of it, that it was over and she wasn’t going to hear from him again.
She had no idea who she was dealing with — or even what his name was, or
how he knew what he did about her. From the moment she agreed to steal
the files, she had a real sense of getting in over her head, and, coming from
someone who worked with Bett, that was saying something.

So she hadn’t played hard and she hadn’t played cute, but she hadn’t played
it entirely stupid either. She didn’t give up the stick before making copies of
the files, albeit as much out of habit as any kind of strategic thinking. Lex was
an obsessive when it came to backing up data, and the harder it had been to
create or acquire something, the more insurance she required against it being
wiped. Given what she’d gone through to swipe the Marledog files, there was
no way she was going to entrust their integrity to a flimsy USB stick. She’d
copied the portable memory to her laptop immediately when she got back on
the chopper, then transferred the data to the PC in her apartment as soon as
she got home.

It had just been a matter of back-up, nothing more underhand, and nothing
he hadn’t anticipated anyway.

Tve no way of knowing whether you've copied these files and you’ve no
way of proving you haven't,’ he said. ‘But if you do have copies, I’d advise
you to erase them right away and to do so without looking at them. What’s
on them won’t mean much to you anyway, but as I always say, what you don’t
know, you can’t be tortured to reveal.’

She hadn’t examined them, not even the DivX audio-visual files, not having
needed any dire warnings to reason that it was best for her own protection to
be only the courier. She was paranoid enough about saying something that
would give her away to Bett, a danger that would be greatly exacerbated by
a burden of knowledge she wasn’t supposed to have. One wrong word -— or
rather one informed word - and she might have a lot of explaining to do.

Nor had she felt remotely comfortable about storing this stuff on her hard
drive at home, despite the data being re-encrypted, the file-extensions altered
to disguise their nature and the whole cache buried somewhere so deep in
the hierarchy that nobody would ever stumble across them unless they really
knew what they were doing. Erasing the files seemed like the most logical
and sensible thing to do because, once they were gone, so was the evidence
of what she’d done, meaning she could draw a line under the whole thing.

However, logic and sense were not enough to overcome Lex’s instinct and
compulsion: when it came to data, she only erased what she was sure she’d
never need again, which had thus far included only mislabelled MP3s and
emails offering to make her penis twice as long. For Christ’s sake, she still had
a CD up ona shelf, full of save-game files so she could pick up where she left
off if she ever felt like reinstalling Doom II. There was no way she was trashing
the Marledog files for the sake of most probably only fleeting peace of mind.

There was a compromise: if she wouldn’t be remotely comfortable storing
the files locally, then she would be comfortable storing the files remotely. She
copied them to an FTP server and committed its address to memory, before
wiping all trace of the server and the Marledogq files from her system. After
that they were out of sight and increasingly out of mind.

Until Bett rang the doorbell.

‘Grab what you need — absolute basics and essentials,’ he said, once she’d
sufficiently recovered from her shock to step aside and let him stride through
the door into her hall. ‘Something’s come up, time-sensitive. Rebekah’s prep-
ping the Little Prince.’

‘Do I need overnight stuff? I mean, like, how long?’ she managed to mum-
ble.

Just put on something you didn’t sleep in and bring whatever brain capacity
isn’t currently online, which doesn’t appear to be much. Come on.’

Tll be right there,’ she said, going to the bedroom to change her underwear
and pull on a fresh T-shirt and some jeans. She was indeed still wearing what

she’d slept in last night, or fairer to say she’d slept for a while in what she was
wearing when she started work. ‘I just need a second,’ she called out. ‘I didn’t
know you were coming. Why didn’t you page me?’

‘1 did,’ he replied, with testily over-pronounced patience. ‘Twice. After that,
I had ascertained you were likely to be Glasgow Coma Scale four in front of
that monitor and was on the verge of calling Armand instead, but as you were
the first person I thought of when this thing came up, I set off in the hope
of having greater success via your doorbell. For your information, you had
approximately twenty more seconds before I kicked the door in and dragged
you physically away from the computer.’

‘Sorry, sir. It was the Lisbon project. I figured out a way to get beyond this
impasse between—’

‘Relevance suspended. Get your laptop. We’re going back to Deimos.’

That last word echoed around Lex’s head as she descended the stairs and
followed Bett out to the street, where his Porsche was waiting. She’d no
idea what this was about yet, and no rational reason, therefore, to make any
assumptions, but merely hearing the name again was enough to unsettle her.
Marledog hadn’t gone away. She may have cached the evidence and covered
her connection to it, but there was no way of knowing what might have been
set in motion when she handed over those files.

Bett’s other remarks did little to quell her unease, and she was wary of how
they piqued her curiosity. You were the first person I thought of when this thing
came up. Why, she wondered, though her desire to vocalise this question was
tempered by the returning fear that in doing so she might give something
away. Would it sound strangely defensive for her to ask this, or would a lack
of curiosity be more suspicious?

She wasn’t cut out for bare-faced deceit. Stealth and subterfuge, sure thing,
but not this. Trying to remember what ought to be natural, what she should
or shouldn’t appear to know, was never something she’d enjoyed much of a
facility for. Not offline, anyway.

Happily, Bett saved her from making the decision; less happily, his words
did anything but allay her anxieties.

‘We’re not going back to Marledog itself,’ he explained, pulling away on
to the quiet, narrow street, ‘but to Chassignan, where a lot of the workers
live. However, the job should nonetheless provide you with an opportunity to
redeem your little lapse there in December.’

‘Yes, sir,’ she said, as neutrally as her acting talents would allow, then re-
mained silent, not because she reasoned it the best policy, but because she’d
be struggling to keep the tremble from her voice if she said anything else.

This was one occasion when it was definitely the right stance to sound like
she knew what he was referring to, even though she didn’t. If by her lapse

he meant her spot of privateering, then it was wisest to play it straight and
thus play it down. ‘Oh yes, that, sir. I was wondering when you'd bring it
up.’ But realistically, he wouldn’t be this calm if that was what he was talking
about. Not unless he was being truly, dispassionately sadistic, a thought too
frightening to contemplate. Her stilted answer precluded finding out what
other lapse he could mean, but to do else would alert him that there was
more than one lapse to consider; or, almost as suicidal, suggest she couldn’t
immediately think of any flaw in her performance that she needed to make up
for.

They arrived in Chassignan a few hours later, Rebekah on air-chauffeur duty
and evidently not much else given that Bett had begun briefing Lex in the
passenger cabin and thus excluded their pilot from the discussion. Lex lapped
up the information, sparse as it turned out to be, because every detail was
further reassurance that Bett’s agenda was something other than that which
she feared.

‘One of their staff has gone missing,’ he said. ‘And not the janitor, as ’m
sure you can guess.’

Bett told her the name and she nodded, disguising the fact that it meant
nothing to her. This in itself was not significant. Names were seldom the thing
that stuck about people Lex met; stories, yeah, mannerisms, sure, hair, relative
height. Not names. Everybody had one. Online handles were a different story,
because at first they were all you had to remember someone by, but out in the
Big Room, other aspects usually proved more memorable. In this case, then, it
was no surprise she was drawing a blank. She’d only been to Marledog for less
than two hours three months ago, and as her principal interaction with most
employees had been shooting them with tranquilliser darts, none of them had
much time to make an impression, far less tell her their names.

Except one. Ah. And now she had it: not just who Bett was talking about,
but what her ‘lapse’ had been. The feeling of relief — that he meant the lab-
geek who’d got the drop on her — lasted for roughly the time it took to remem-
ber why the guy had been able to catch her off guard.

‘He’s in Research and Development, presumably working on something
rather important. In my experience, there are few companies sufficiently con-
cerned about employee welfare as to bring in professional help when one
of their wage-slaves takes an unannounced mental-health day, and weapons
manufacturers would be well down that list. If he was replaceable, they’d
already be hiring.’

‘So how missing is missing? Has he been gone long?’

‘Details are sketchy, and I wouldn’t expect them to get much clearer any
time soon. What you'll have to keep in mind throughout this business is that
we are dealing with the arms industry. These people are secretive and disin-

genuous when they’re asking you to pass the milk over breakfast. Just because
they need our help and they’re paying us doesn’t mean they'll actually tell us
what we need to know in order to get the job done.’

‘And why do they need us to get the job done? I’m guessing they don’t want
the police involved—

‘Very good, you're learning.’

‘But this isn’t exactly our speciality either’

‘Quite. The police won’t get involved in a missing-person case unless there’s
firm evidence of criminal activity, and if there is firm evidence of criminal
activity, you can be damn sure Industries Deimos won’t want the police getting
involved. They came to us because we are a known quantity. We have a
relationship with them and they trust us. Two seconds to identify the error in
that statement.’

‘Arms companies trust no one.’

‘Correct. So in this context, by trust I mean they believe they can control
our involvement and remunerate us sufficiently to guarantee our discretion
after the fact.’

‘And would the cache of gizmos we stole from them in December for Som
to play around with constitute a down payment on this remuneration?’

‘Not as far as Deimos are aware. The loss of such items merely highlighted
the prevalence and ease of pilfering from the facility under such lax security
conditions.’

Lex blanked out the more paranoid interpretations of this remark.

‘I guess they wouldn’t have called if they knew otherwise,’ she said, thinking
of the true extent of that night’s theft.

‘Oh, they might, they might. In the grand scheme, quite probably. If they
needed us enough, they wouldn't let something as trivial as that get in the
way. And they do need us. However, the main reason they've come to us
pertains to the main thing we need to know and the last thing they're going
to tell us.’

‘Which would be what?’

‘Whatever they’re afraid of. Locating a missing person is, as you said, not
our speciality. So I'd be surprised if Deimos haven’t also engaged the services
of others whose forte it most certainly is; freelance investigators, maybe the
odd cop who’s on backhanders. But I would predict that tracking down the
missing scientist will prove less than half the battle. They came to us because
they suspect that even once located, their quarry won't be easily retrieved.
And retrieving what is guarded and hidden, my dear Alexis, most definitely is
our speciality.’

They landed in a field outside of the village, and were met by Nicholas Willis,

who’d been waiting for them by a large silver Mercedes. Willis was a tall,
gaunt, middle-aged guy, bald of pate with trimmed patches of white hair
above his ears. He was dressed in a suit and a greatcoat, but Lex pictured him
wearing a cravat and frilly cuffs on his days off. He looked like ‘Old Money’,
as her monetarily preoccupied (and not a little snobbish) grandmother would
have approvingly observed.

Rebekah killed the engines but stayed with the helicopter while Lex fol-
lowed Bett to the car. Bett got into the passenger seat, Willis chivalrously
opening the rear driver’s-side door for Lex. Bett and Willis exchanged pleas-
antries but avoided the matter in hand, like they didn’t want to prejudice the
experiment. Willis would have already told Bett all he could, or all he was
prepared to, leastways, so there was nothing much to add prior to seeing the
apartment. They spoke in English, Willis sounding even more Old Money than
he looked.

Some people’s accents altered in response to certain others’: hardening and
running to the colloquial, softening to accommodate an unaccustomed ear,
stiffening in formality. Sometimes it was a relaxation, other times a courtesy;
it could be a posture or a statement, and it could be entirely subconscious.
Bett’s accent did not alter one micro-nuance. This at least provided some
suggestion that English wasn’t his first language, but no further clues to his
provenance. Chalk another one up to Mr Impervious.

The journey took less than three minutes. Chassignan was a pleasant but
mousy little place, not so much sleepy as in chronic stasis. A small gas sta-
tion was the only immediate exemplar of twentieth-century construction on
the tree-lined main street, otherwise flanked by tall, well-maintained and uni-
formly shuttered apartment buildings. Lex’s own place dated from the early
nineteenth century, and these looked of a similar period or older. Closer exam-
ination of a few shop windows broke the fairy tale spell: recent DVD posters
in the tabac, Microsloth and Macintrash logos looking out through the glass of
an internet café. They had broadband ISPs and they had Vin Diesel flicks, so
the village knew there was good progress and bad progress, but she couldn’t
imagine much had really changed around here in a couple of centuries. Had
to be an abduction, she thought, sarcastically. How could anybody leave all
this?

Fleming’s apartment was one street back from the main drag. It was on the
fourth floor of five (or the troisiéme étage, the way the Europeans counted it),
up a bright and airy stairwell with broad stone steps and wide, solid landings.
Willis led the way on long, spindly legs, the hard leather soles of his shoes
tapping loudly on the stone with each step. They looked and sounded expen-
sive; the gait and footwear of a man unafraid to announce his approach. Lex
glanced at her scuffed training shoes, their impacts dampened almost apolo-

getically by chunky man-made grips. There was a good reason people called
them sneakers.

Bett walked at the rear on Doc Marten patent Airware. The soles cushioned
his steps, but his frame carried enough muscle for his footfalls to reverberate
with a formidable sense of presence she could feel as well as hear. He was
looking around as he ascended, scanning, analysing, evaluating, filing. Lex
knew she could look in the same places and see no more than a staircase,
which made her wonder what use Bett expected her to be when they reached
the flat.

Willis pulled a set of keys from his greatcoat pocket, delicately undoing the
lock before turning the handle with a grimace, as though he was opening a
wound.

‘Where did you get the keys?’ Bett asked.

Willis stepped aside from the door.

‘Oh, from our property manager. It’s a new lock. He put it in to replace the
other one, which was ruined.’

Bett had a look at the doorframe. ‘It wasn’t forced,’ he observed.

‘No, drilled, he said. Drilled through.’

‘And you told me on the phone that nobody in the building heard anything?’

‘Property manager believes it was a...’ Willis mimed turning a crank. ‘You
know?’

‘Yes. Stealthier, but slow. You own the building?’

‘We own the apartment. We have a few dotted around. If you want to
headhunt gifted staff, you have to be able to accommodate them immediately.
Some stay just until they find a place themselves, but others ...’

‘How long was Fleming here, then?’

‘Two years. Shall we ...?’ Willis invited, with visible reluctance and dis-
taste.

They stepped into the small hallway, which was little more than a conduit
between three rooms, the largest of which was an open-plan kitchen and living
area.

‘Have you been in here before?’ Bett asked. ‘I mean, since ...’

‘Yes. We tried not to disturb anything. I don’t find it particularly comfort-
able, to be frank, being in someone else’s home without his say-so, but the
buck stops here, as they say.’

Lex could sympathise. It was not a comfortable place to be. The feng shui
was all off. The sofa, for instance, was at a psychologically jarring angle
(upright was more calming), and, in her judgement, pot plants worked best
when they weren’t lying sideways across the floor.

‘Alexis, the camera,’ Bett reminded her. She pulled it from a pouch on her
laptop satchel and began taking shots of the scene, snapping as she picked

her footsteps carefully amid the mess. The only clutter-free areas were the
shelves and bookcases, because all of their contents had been scattered about
the floor. CDs lay fanned-out like fallen dominoes, next to books, DVDs and
magazines. Pictures had been pulled from the walls and left on the floor,
though Lex noted that the glass was intact on each of them. The only wall-
hung decorations remaining were glossy pin-ups in two clusters: one in the
kitchen and one next to the computer. Soccer players, tour posters, some
movie stills.

A flat-screen monitor sat on a desk by the farther of two broad windows, the
PC itself nestling underneath, surrounded by piles of blank and used printer
paper, stacked like kindling. A pale green light indicated activity.

The kitchen area was a real treat. Rice, pasta, flour, salt, breakfast cereals,
washing powder and dishwasher tablets had been emptied out on to the floor
and their containers discarded on top. Pots and pans had been pulled from
cupboards and now lolled like grounded ships upon the banks of powder and
grain. Supermarket ready meals lay around the foot of the fridge-freezer, con-
tents spilling out where the plastic film had broken, their cardboard sleeves
dotted randomly about the floor. Four bottles lay undisturbed on a wine rack
atop the work surface next to the sink, and Lex noticed also that no crockery
had been broken.

In the compact little bathroom, the contents of a mirrored cabinet had been
dumped into the basin directly below, bottles of shampoo and shower gel
tipped into the bath. Again, the shelves and surfaces were clear, including the
cistern lid, which was slightly askew.

The bedroom was the same deal. The place had been tossed, not trashed.

‘How did you find out he was missing?’ Bett asked.

Didn't you ask me this before?’

For the benefit of Miss Richardson here, and to refresh my memory.’

‘Rather undramatic, initially. He failed to turn up for work, although that
was fairly remarkable for him, I suppose. He’d seldom lost a day before that.
When the road has looked like being closed in the winter, he’s often slept
at the lab because he’d rather be stranded that end. When he didn’t call
in by midday, somebody phoned here, to no reply. Couldn’t get him on his
mobile phone, either. Then the property manager got a call from one of the
neighbours who'd noticed the door was ajar and the lock damaged. She’d
rung the bell, then stuck her head inside when there was no answer. When
she saw what she saw...’

‘And you came here yourself? Right away?’

‘I realised that Mr Fleming could have been incommunicado because he was
with the police, reporting a burglary, but if that wasn’t the case, I knew there
was no time to lose. I had to see for myself.’
