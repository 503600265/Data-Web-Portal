Why create a harmonized survey dashboard? 
 
With  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  face-to-face  data  collection  has  become  increasingly 
difficult,  due  to  both  the  health  risks  associated  with  traditional  survey  collection  and  quickly 
evolving  government  restrictions.  To  monitor  the  impact  of  the  pandemic  on  the  poor  and 
vulnerable,  the  World  Bank  has  supported  the  deployment  of  high  frequency  phone  surveys 
through a flexible questionnaire template that can be adapted to country needs, implementation 
manuals, phone survey guidelines, as well as advisory support and financing.

Despite the creation of common survey questionnaire templates with core and optional modules, 
a  fully  standardized  approach  to  COVID-19  survey  monitoring  was  not  possible.  In  many  cases, 
partner countries and national statistical offices had already launched surveys or needed to include 
additional topics of interest. 
  
Given the divergence in survey construction, harmonization was necessary to create a comparable 
picture of how the pandemic affects the live of the poor around the world. Harmonized indicators 
help to track the impact of the pandemic and mitigating policies over time in a comparable manner.  
  
Where does the dashboard survey data come from?  
 
The figures presented in this dashboard are derived from the Rapid Monitoring Database (RMD). 
The RMD is a harmonized collection of high-frequency phone surveys in response to the COVID-19 
crisis conducted by the World Bank Group and partners so that they share a common format. This 
involves  renaming  variables  and  recoding  categories  to  be  consistent  with  a  common  set  of 
guidelines, which facilitates consistent comparison and aggregation across countries.  
  
Creating  the  guidelines  and  the  harmonization  of  the  surveys  equally  require  an  element  of 
judgment. The guidelines were based on a careful a review of the questionnaires that identified 
questions common to several surveys. Questions that were present in a large share of surveys, as 
well as topics of particular interest for monitoring welfare during the crisis, were included in the 
harmonization.  Nonetheless,  surveys  do  not  generally  contain  all  the  questions  listed  in  the 
guidelines. In cases where questions or indicators are not asked in a particular country survey or 
asked in a different way, that indicator is coded as missing in the RMD.  
  
Since surveys are being executed in several waves, updates to the RMD will make it easy to monitor 
changing socio-economic conditions over time.   
 
What are High-Frequency Monitoring Phone Surveys? 
 
The  World  Bank  has  significant  experience  using  phone  surveys  to  monitor  welfare  in  many 
circumstances,  including  in  times  of  crisis  and  in  response  to  emergencies.  Experts  from  teams 
across  the  World  Bank 
leveraged  this  experience  to  develop  technical  materials  and 
implementation  protocols  to  quickly  produce  reliable  information  on  the  impacts  of  COVID-19 
using phone surveys.  
 
A modular global template questionnaire was created to make it easier to adapt surveys to country 
contexts and information needs, while facilitating cross-country comparability and analysis.

Are the surveys representative of the population?  
 
All  high-frequency  mobile  surveys  in  the  dashboard  were  designed  to  be  representative  of  the 
underlying population. However, while a useful tool for data collection during the pandemic, phone 
surveys are not a panacea. They have important limitations, including under-coverage of groups 
with poor network connections or limited access to phones. They are known to be affected by high 
levels  of  non-response  and  attrition.  The  practical  length  of  phone  interviews  is  also  an  issue, 
limiting the breadth and depth of the information that can be collected. 
 
In cases where countries had recently conducted representative household survey that contains 
re-contact information for some or all household members, this data was often used to create a 
representative  sampling  frame for  telephone-based  surveys.  In  other  cases,  list-based  sampling 
frames  used  numbers  from  government  registries,  telecommunications  companies,  marketing 
firms, or other sources to survey representative samples. 
   
It  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  cross-country  comparisons  and  aggregations  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution.  Because  the  surveys  were  collected  by  phone,  they  are  only 
representative  of  phone  owners  who  are  willing  to  respond  to  the  survey.  Differences  in  the 
characteristics  of  phone  owners  are  likely  to  bias  comparisons  across  countries  or  areas. 
Nonetheless, the figures are presented with the belief that putting results in context will shed light 
on differences across countries in the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, which will in turn 
put the survey results into context and inform policy responses.     
 
How was the data harmonized? 
 
The harmonization process was a global effort whereby teams from multiple Global Practices and 
Regions  gathered  to  create  a  data  dictionary  of  frequent,  comparable  and  relevant  survey 
questions  in  order  to  understand  the  impact  of  COVID-19.  Once  a  data  dictionary  was  created, 
several Bank teams and poverty economists embedded in client countries monitored the execution 
of  the  surveys  and  reviewed  the  acquired  data  before  sharing  with  a  team  in  charge  of  the 
harmonization process.  
 
This team reviewed the received raw data and recoded categories to create high-level indicators. 
In cases where questions or indicators are not asked in the survey or asked in a different way, that 
indicator is coded as missing in the RMD.  
 
Because  all  survey  respondents  are  phone  owners,  which  are  likely  to  bias  comparisons  across 
countries or areas, it is difficult to obtain nationally representative results using individual weights. 
To prepare national representative statistics at the individual level in other countries, household 
weights were applied for all the indicators in the dashboard. Care was taken to include accurate 
indicator descriptions to reflect whether the indicator data pertains to individuals or households.

How do I know how survey rounds have been completed in each country? 
 
Nearly all countries in the dashboard will include harmonized indicator data from multiple survey 
rounds. To know if a country contains multiple rounds of data, and when the data was collected, 
simply over data points until a tooltip with additional information appears. (See Figure 2.) 
 

Figure 2. Dashboard Tooltip Example 

 
The tooltip  contains data  on the indicator name, topic, region, country and whether the  data is 
disaggregated  by  National/Urban/Rural  and  Industry  Sector  categories.  It  also  includes  the  data 
when the data was collected and the total number of data points of that indicator. 
 
How do we present disaggregated data? 
 
Current data can be  disaggregated at the respondent level by Urban/Rural and Industry Sector, 
however  these  figures  should  be  taken  with  caution.  Limitations  inherent  to  phone  surveys, 
including under-coverage of groups with poor network connections or limited access to  phones 
may lead to selection biases and issues with representation. For example, despite the near ubiquity 
of mobile devices, there are significant gaps in phone ownership by gender and profession. These 
gaps  vary  hugely  across  countries.  Although  in  most  cases  the  sampled  phone  numbers  are  for 
households  and  individuals  that  had  been  interviewed  face-to-face  by  a  recent  survey.  We  will 
continue conducting exercises to understand and account for selection biases associated with lack 
of cell phone ownership, non-response, and attrition. 
 
Why do some countries not appear in the dashboard?  Will you add more countries? 
 
The countries displayed in the dashboard are those that have completed at least one survey round 
and have had survey data harmonized to match the dashboard data structure. In some cases, data 

4 

agreements  between  the  survey  collection  agencies  -  partner  governments,  national  statistical 
offices, and multilateral agencies – and data privacy concerns restrict the data that can be made 
publicly available. In other cases, surveys are still in progress or are completed but have not yet 
been harmonized.  
 
At  the  time  of  the  dashboard  launch  on  November  11,  2020,  it  contained  survey  data  from  43 
countries. In  most countries, survey rounds are conducted every 4-6 weeks over a period  of 12 
months.  As  the  COVID-19  pandemic  continues,  new  rounds  of  HFPS  will  continue  in  many 
countries. By early 2021, we expect to have harmonized survey data from around 100 countries in 
the  dashboard.  Around  the  same  time,  we  intend  to  make  -  whenever  feasible  -  anonymized 
microdata  available  in  the World  Bank  Microdata  Library,  recognizing  that  there  are  country 
specificities with respect to data access and remaining mindful of data privacy considerations.

Methology Note: COVID-19 High-Frequency Survey (HFS) in Latin American Countries 
 
Sampling Design and Weighing *
 
 
The	COVID-19	High-Frequency	Survey	was	conducted	by	phone	in	thirteen	Latin	American	countries:	
Argentina,	Bolivia,	Chile,	Colombia,	Costa	Rica,	Dominican	Republic,	Ecuador,	El	Salvador,	Guatemala,	
 
Honduras,	Mexico,	Paraguay	and	Peru.	Data	collection	spanned	over	three	waves	between	May	and	
 
 
 
August	2020,	and	collection	periods	lasted	about	ten	days	per	wave	on	average.	The	survey	interviewed	
 
 
one	adult	per	household	and	asked	both	individual	and	household-level	questions.
 
 
All	national	samples	are	based	on	a	dual	frame	of	cell	phones	and	landlines	and	have	a	probability	one-	
 
stage	design	with	geographic	stratification.	The	samples	were	generated	through	a	Random	Digit	Dialing	
 
 
(RDD)	process,	thus	ensuring	coverage	of	all	landline	and	cell	phone	numbers	active	at	the	time	of	the	
survey.
 
Survey	estimates	for	each	country	represent	households	with	a	landline	or	in	which	at	least	one	member	
 
 
 
has	a	cell	phone,	and	individuals	18	years	of	age	or	above	who	have	an	active	cell	phone	number	or	a	
 
landline	at	home.
 
Sampling design
 
Each country’s sample is based on a dual frame of cell phone and landline numbers generated through 
an RDD process. The RDD methodology produces all possible phone numbers in the country under the 
national phone numbering plan and draws a random sample of numbers. This way, the process 
guarantees full coverage of phone numbers and eliminates any potential coverage bias with respect to 
the population with a phone1. 
 
First, in each country a large first-phase sample was selected in each of both number frames, with an 
allocation ranging from 0% landlines and 100% cell phones to 20% landlines and 80% cell phones (which 
can be distinguished based on their prefixes). Landlines were included with a small share in order to 
cover the landline-only households and persons, which have a low prevalence in most Latin American 
countries but yet exist, particularly among the senior population. 
 
In all countries, the landline frame was geographically stratified by department, province or state, and 
the sample of landlines was selected with proportionate allocation among strata. Geographic 
proportionate stratification was also done for cell phones in Argentina, Bolivia and México2. It is 
underscored that the HFS sample design permits to obtain precise estimates at the country level only. 
Subnational estimates would have large sampling errors. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

* This technical note was prepared by Ramiro Flores Cruz, partner member at Sistemas Integrales and World Bank 
consultant. 

1 In other words, given that the HFS used a sampling frame of phone numbers, its results represent only the 
population with a phone and exclude the population with no phone. 

2 Geographic stratification of cell phone numbers was feasible only in these three countries because only in them it 
is possible to link a cell phone number to the district (department, province or state) where it was issued.

The first-phase samples of landline and cell phone numbers were then screened through an automated 
process to identify the active numbers, and these were then cross-checked with business registries 
(based on yellow pages and websites) to identify business numbers, not eligible for this survey. 
 
Second, a smaller second-phase sample3 was selected from the active residential numbers identified in 
the first-phase sample and was delivered to the country team to be called by the interviewers. The 
reason for selecting a second-phase sample was that delivering a large first-phase sample of active 
numbers to the country teams at once could facilitate the “misuse” of the sample, raise nonresponse 
rates, and increase potential nonresponse biases. 
 
Table 1 shows the final sample size per country and the allocation between both frames.4

When an interview was obtained through a cell phone, the interviewer interviewed the person who 
answered the call (as long as he or she was 18 years of age or above) and asked all questions about the 
respondent and his or her household. When an interview was obtained through a landline, the 
interviewer requested to talk to any household member 18 years of age or older and asked all questions 
about the respondent and his or her household. Landlines are 10% - 15% of the sample in most 
countries, 20% in two of them, and 0% in three of them. 
 
Respondents were recontacted in two additional rounds, thus producing panel data. 

 

3 Note that the selection of phone numbers involves two sampling phases, and not two sampling stages. 

4 The HFS samples have one-stage, so the design effects of all variables equal 1, or are even smaller than 1 due to 
stratification. As a result, the effective sample sizes are equal or larger than the nominal sizes, reducing the 
standard errors. This feature contrasts with multi-stage clustered samples, which typically have design effects 
significantly larger than 1 and, therefore, their effective sizes are smaller than their nominal size, increasing the 
standard errors.

Weighting
 
The HFS has two sample units: households and individuals. Sampling weights were computed for each 
unit and should be used according to the estimate of interest. The weighting process involves four steps: 
 

1.  Calculation of the inclusion probabilities of landline and cell phone numbers. 

2.  Computation of base weights for households and individuals. 

3.  Nonresponse weighting adjustment. 

4.  Calibration of individual and household weights, using external data from official sources 

(adjusted for the national phone coverage). 

 

 

 

 
In the second and third HFS waves, household and individual weights were adjusted for attrition. 
 
Step 1: Inclusion probabilities of landline and cell phone numbers
 
 
A first-phase sample was selected in each of the two frames (cell phone numbers and landline numbers) 
with simple random selection without replacement, and the automated screening classified the selected 
numbers into active and inactive. The first-phase inclusion probabilities of cell phones and landlines are5

Step 2: Base weights for households and individuals
 
The selection probabilities of households and individuals 18+ are based on the inclusion probabilities of 
the cell phone and landline numbers through which they are reached. Therefore, the computation of 
household and individual weights should account for multiplicity and for the specific overlapping pattern 
between the frames of cell phones and landlines. Otherwise, household and individual-level estimates 
will be biased. 
 
Multiplicity adjustment 
 
There is multiplicity when a household has a larger selection probability because it can be selected 
through different sample elements. Thus, if a household has more than one cell phone or more than one 
landline, the household selection probability needs to be adjusted to account for the increased chance 
of selection. The multiplicity-adjusted household selection probabilities in each frame are computed as 
 

 𝐿  
 = 𝑚𝑙𝑗 ℎ𝑖

 𝐶 
 𝐶  = 𝑚𝑐𝑗 𝑖
 𝑚𝑗
 
 𝐿
 𝑚ℎ𝑗
 
where 
 
 𝐶  is selection probability of the j-th household when contacted through a cell phone, adjusted 
 𝑚𝑗
for multiplicity of working cell phones in the household 

𝑚𝑐𝑗 is the number of working cell phones in the j-th household 

is the selection probability of the j-th household in stratum h when contacted through a 

 𝐿
 𝑚ℎ𝑗 
landline, adjusted for multiplicity of working landlines in the household 

𝑚𝑙𝑗 is the number of working landlines in the j-th household 

 
Therefore, if a household has mc cell phones, its chance of being selected through a cell phone is mc 
higher than a household where there is only one cell phone. The same applies to landlines, in which case 
the multiplicity factor is ml. Since the number of cell phones and landlines in a household is unknown at 
the time of the sample design, it needs to be asked during the interview as part of the questionnaire. 
 
The probability of an individual being selected through a cell phone equals the inclusion probability of 
his or her cell phone number. On the other hand, the probability of an individual being selected through 
a landline equals the selection probability of his or her household, conditional on the number of working 
landlines in the household, over the number of adult individuals in the household:

Overlapping sampling frames 
 
Households and individuals that have both cell phone and landline (dual cases) have a higher probability 
of being selected than those which have only cell phones or only landlines. The following diagram 
displays the overlapping pattern of cell phone and landline sampling frames.

In order to adjust the selection probabilities for overlapping frames and multiplicity, it is essential to 
collect some related information during the interview. It is necessary to know the domain ownership of 
the sample households and individuals, as well as the number of cell phones and landlines in the sample 
households. To this purpose, the HFS questionnaire included the following three questions: 
 

1. How many working cell phones in total are owned by the persons in your household, including you? 

 

2. Is there any working landline in your household? 

3. How many working landlines are there in your household currently? 

 
By knowing the domain of ownership, the selection probability for each sample unit can be calculated 
based on the following probability property 
 

𝑃 (𝐴⋃𝐵) = 𝑃 (𝐴) + 𝑃 (𝐵) − 𝑃 (𝐴⋂𝐵) 

where 𝑃 (𝐴⋂𝐵) = 𝑃 (𝐴) × 𝑃 (𝐵), given that A and B are independent

Step 3: Nonresponse adjustment
 
When a phone number is called, it is not always possible to carry out an interview. Nonresponse occurs 
either because nobody answers the call (no contact), because the respondent is unwilling to cooperate 
(refusal), or because of other barriers such as language. 
 
The HFS put in place four main strategies to minimize nonresponse: 
 

a.  The survey central management team sent SMSs to the sample cell phone numbers before 

calling to inform the user who was about to call and to persuade him or her to answer the call.

b. 

In some countries, the sample was released to the country teams over successive replicates in 
order to keep nonresponse properly monitored and under the control of the central 
management team. 

c.  Stringent calling protocols were put in place and monitored to ensure a minimum number of 

attempts on different days and times (5 to 10 attempts depending on the country). 

d.  The survey offered monetary and nonmonetary incentives to those who cooperated (gift cards 

and phone credit). 

e. 

In some countries, the most experienced interviewers recontacted the numbers classified as a 
“Refusal” to convert them into a “Complete interview”. 

 
These actions allowed reaching response rates higher than similar studies based on RDD samples. Final 
nonresponse rates varied across the HFS countries, with the lowest levels in Bolivia and Ecuador, and 
the highest in Argentina and Mexico. 
 
The base weights of the responding households and individuals were adjusted to compensate for 
nonresponse and thus reduce the potential bias it may cause on the survey estimates. For this purpose, 
a class-based adjustment was used. This approach consists of forming classes by crossing all categories 
of auxiliary variables that are both known to be correlated with the likelihood of responding and are 
available for respondents and nonrespondents. Given that the survey used an RDD sample, the 
information in the sampling frame was limited and the only variables known for both respondents and 
nonrespondents were the type of phone number (landline or cell phone) and the corresponding 
geographic region (known for landlines in all countries, and for cell phones only in Argentina, Bolivia and 
Mexico). 
 
One type of weighting class nonresponse adjustment is based on the inverse of the weighted response 
rate estimate in each class. This is the ratio of the sum of the base weights for all units (respondents and 
nonrespondents) in class c to the sum of the base weights for the respondents in that class.

where ajc is the nonresponse adjustment factor that should be applied to responding households in 
class c, and akc is the nonresponse adjustment factor for responding individuals in that class. R and NR 
indicate the responding and nonresponding units, respectively. 
 
Thus, the nonresponse adjusted weights for responding households and individuals are 
 

𝑤′𝑗

   = 𝑤0𝑗 𝑎𝑗𝑐 

𝑤′𝑘

   = 𝑤0𝑘 𝑎𝑘𝑐

Step 4: Calibration if individual and household weights
 
As the last step, the weights for the responding households and individuals were calibrated using 
external data from official sources. This last adjustment has two objectives: 
 

 

 

-  Use auxiliary variables from external sources to further reduce potential nonresponse biases that 
were not addressed by the auxiliary variables used in Step 3. This can be achieved as long as the 
calibration auxiliaries are correlated with nonresponse.  

-  Improve the precision of estimators (i.e. reduce the sampling variances), as long as the auxiliaries 

are correlated with the analysis variables of interest.7 

 
The goal of calibration is to find a set of weights that are close to the input weights (nonresponse 
adjusted weights in this case), and when used to estimate totals of the auxiliaries, reproduce the 
population totals exactly. Put formally, calibration minimizes a measure of the distance8 between the 
input weights and the calibrated weights, under the constraint that the sum of the calibrated weights 
equals the sum of the totals of the auxiliaries from an external source. Unlike the nonresponse 
adjustment carried out in the previous step, calibration requires that the auxiliary variables be available 
for respondents only, and not for both respondents and nonrespondents. 
 
Among the several existing calibration techniques, the HFS used the raking method. This method was 
most suitable given that the available auxiliary variables (region, sex and age groups) were all 
categorical, that region had many categories in most countries, and that the HFS samples are rather 
small. 
 
The final weights for responding households and individuals can then be expressed as 
 

𝑤𝑗 = 𝑤𝑗

𝑤𝑘= 𝑤𝑘

′ 𝑔𝑗 = 𝑤0𝑗 𝑎𝑗𝑐 𝑔𝑗 
′  𝑔𝑘= 𝑤0𝑘 𝑎𝑘𝑐 𝑔𝑘 

where 
 

𝑤0𝑗 is the base weight for the j-th household 

𝑎𝑗𝑐 is the nonresponse adjustment factor for households in class c 

𝑔𝑗 is the calibration factor for the j-th household 

𝑤0𝑘 is the base weight for the k-th individual 
𝑎𝑘𝑐 is the nonresponse adjustment factor for individuals in class c 
𝑔𝑘 is the calibration factor for the k-th individual 

 

7 This objective was not addressed in this survey since it would have entailed computing a large set of replicate 
weights (with bootstrap or jackknife replication methods), which could be confusing for the final user and lead to 
error when estimating. 

8 The HFS weight calibration applies the raking calibration method, using the logit distance function.

Table 2 shows the data sources used for calibrating the weights in each country. All the population 
counts taken from these sources were adjusted for telephone coverage, using the national phone 
coverage rates published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) from the United Nations.
